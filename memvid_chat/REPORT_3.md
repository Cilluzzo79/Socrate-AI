# Report 3: Database Implementation

## Date
September 26, 2025

## Completed Tasks
1. Designed and implemented SQLAlchemy database models
2. Created database operations module for CRUD operations
3. Implemented document synchronization functionality
4. Added conversation and message management
5. Created database initialization script

## Database Schema
- **Users**: Store user information and preferences
- **Documents**: Track available Memvid documents with metadata
- **Conversations**: Maintain conversation history linked to users and documents
- **Messages**: Store individual messages within conversations

## Key Features
- Automatic document discovery and synchronization
- User profile management and tracking
- Persistent conversation history across sessions
- Message metadata for storing retrieval information
- Efficient query operations for conversation management

## Files Created
- `database/models.py` - SQLAlchemy ORM models
- `database/operations.py` - Database operation functions
- `database/init_db.py` - Database initialization script

## Implementation Details
- Used SQLAlchemy for ORM and database operations
- Implemented JSON serialization for metadata fields
- Created relationships between tables for efficient querying
- Added utility functions for common database operations
- Designed with SQLite for local development, but supports any SQLAlchemy-compatible database

## Next Steps
1. Implement Memvid integration for document retrieval
2. Build OpenRouter API client for LLM integration
3. Create Telegram bot interface
4. Connect all components together in the main application

## Notes
- The database is designed to be efficient and scalable
- All timestamps are stored in UTC for consistency
- Document synchronization keeps the database in sync with filesystem
- Conversation history is preserved for continuity between sessions
