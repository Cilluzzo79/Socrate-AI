# Report 4: Core Functionality Implementation

## Date
September 26, 2025

## Completed Tasks
1. Implemented Memvid retriever manager for document interaction
2. Created OpenRouter client for LLM integration
3. Developed RAG pipeline connecting retrieval and generation
4. Added caching for efficient document retrieval
5. Implemented conversation history integration

## Key Components
- **MemvidRetrieverManager**: Manages retrievers for different documents with caching
- **OpenRouterClient**: Handles API communication with OpenRouter/Claude
- **RAG Pipeline**: Orchestrates the retrieval and generation process

## Features Implemented
- Efficient caching of Memvid retrievers to reduce memory usage
- Robust error handling for API calls and document retrieval
- Conversation history integration for contextual responses
- User preference support for retrieval and generation parameters
- Automatic document management and synchronization

## Files Created
- `core/memvid_retriever.py` - Memvid integration and retrieval logic
- `core/llm_client.py` - OpenRouter API client
- `core/rag_pipeline.py` - Main RAG pipeline implementation

## Implementation Details
- Used dataclasses for type-safe retrieval results
- Implemented retriever caching with time-based expiration
- Added proper error handling for all external API calls
- Created helper functions for common operations
- Designed the system to handle conversation history effectively

## Next Steps
1. Implement Telegram bot interface
2. Create commands for document selection and settings management
3. Add beta mode features for parameter customization
4. Develop main application to connect all components
5. Create initialization and deployment scripts

## Notes
- The core functionality is now complete and ready for integration
- The system handles both retrieval and generation in a modular way
- User preferences are respected throughout the pipeline
- Conversation history is maintained for better context
- The system is designed to be resilient to errors and API issues
