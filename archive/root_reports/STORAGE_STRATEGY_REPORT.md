The solution leverages Cloudflare R2 for scalable, cost-effective object storage with a tiered user quota system designed to sustain operations within the free tier while generating revenue through premium subscriptions.

---

## 1. Storage Architecture

### 1.1 Technology Choice: Cloudflare R2

**Selected Solution**: Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible object storage)

**Reasons for Selection**:
- **Zero egress fees**: Unlike AWS S3, R2 charges no fees for data retrieval
- **10GB free tier**: Sufficient for initial user base (100-200 users)
- **S3-compatible API**: Easy migration to other providers if needed
- **Global CDN integration**: Fast access via Cloudflare's edge network
- **GDPR compliance**: Europe endpoint selected for data sovereignty
- **99.9% uptime SLA**: Enterprise-grade reliability

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Database BLOB storage** ❌
   - Not scalable for large files
   - Increases database size and backup costs
   - Slow query performance

2. **AWS S3** ❌
   - Egress fees ($0.09/GB after 100GB)
   - Would cost $9/month for 100GB traffic
   - More expensive at scale

3. **Local filesystem** ❌
   - Railway containers are ephemeral
   - No shared storage between Web and Worker services
   - Data loss on container restart

### 1.2 Storage Organization

**File Structure**:
```
R2_BUCKET: socrate-ai-storage
├── users/{user_id}/
│   └── docs/{document_id}/
│       ├── {filename}.pdf
│       ├── {filename}_sections_metadata.json
│       └── {filename}_sections_index.json
```

**Key Generation** (core/s3_storage.py:171):
```python
def generate_file_key(user_id: str, document_id: str, filename: str) -> str:
    """Generate S3 key: users/{user_id}/docs/{doc_id}/{filename}"""
    safe_filename = "".join(c for c in filename if c.isalnum() or c in ('._- ')).strip()
    return f"users/{user_id}/docs/{document_id}/{safe_filename}"
```

**Benefits**:
- User isolation for GDPR compliance
- Easy per-user storage calculation
- Efficient deletion when users leave
- Organized audit trails

### 1.3 Implementation Details

**Upload Flow** (api_server.py:338-418):
1. User uploads file via REST API (multipart/form-data)
2. Flask reads file content into memory
3. Generate unique document ID (UUID)
4. Upload to R2: `users/{user_id}/docs/{doc_id}/{filename}`
5. Store R2 key in PostgreSQL `documents.file_path`
6. Trigger Celery task for async processing

**Processing Flow** (tasks.py:68-95):
1. Celery worker retrieves document metadata from PostgreSQL
2. Download file from R2 using stored key
3. Save to temporary directory (`tempfile.mkdtemp()`)
4. Run memvid encoder on temp file
5. Upload processed metadata/index back to R2
6. Update document status in database
7. Delete temporary files (`shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)`)

**Key Code Sections**:
- Upload: api_server.py:359-369
- Download: tasks.py:69-95
- R2 client: core/s3_storage.py:24-43
- Cleanup: tasks.py:244-249

## 2. Cost Analysis

### 2.1 Cloudflare R2 Pricing

**Free Tier**:
- Storage: 10 GB/month
- Class A operations (writes): 1 million/month
- Class B operations (reads): 10 million/month
- Egress: **Unlimited** (no fees)

**Paid Tier** (after exceeding free tier):
- Storage: $0.015/GB/month (~€0.014/GB)
- Class A: $4.50 per million operations
- Class B: $0.36 per million operations

### 2.2 Projected Costs at Scale

**Scenario 1: Within Free Tier (0-200 users)**
- Average 50MB per user
- Total: 10GB storage
- **Monthly cost**: €0 (free tier)

**Scenario 2: Small Scale (200-500 users)**
- Average 50MB per user
- Total: 25GB storage
- Exceeded: 15GB paid
- **Monthly cost**: €0.21 (15GB × €0.014)

**Scenario 3: Medium Scale (500-1000 users)**
- Average 50MB per user
- Total: 50GB storage
- Exceeded: 40GB paid
- **Monthly cost**: €0.56 (40GB × €0.014)

**Scenario 4: Large Scale (1000-5000 users)**
- Average 50MB per user
- Total: 250GB storage
- Exceeded: 240GB paid
- **Monthly cost**: €3.36 (240GB × €0.014)

**Operations Cost** (negligible):
- 1000 users × 10 uploads/month = 10,000 writes
- 1000 users × 100 queries/month = 100,000 reads
- Well within free tier (1M writes, 10M reads)

## 3. Monetization Strategy

### 3.1 User Quota System

**Implemented in database.py:82-83**:
```python
subscription_tier = Column(String(20), default='free')  # free, pro, enterprise
storage_quota_mb = Column(Integer, default=500)
storage_used_mb = Column(Integer, default=0)
```

**Tier Structure**:

| Tier       | Storage Quota | Monthly Price | Target Users          |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Free       | 100 MB        | €0            | Trial users           |
| Pro        | 5 GB          | €9.99/month   | Regular users         |
| Enterprise | 50 GB         | €49.99/month  | Power users/companies |

### 3.2 Revenue Projections

**Target: 1000 Active Users**

**Conservative Scenario (80% free, 15% pro, 5% enterprise)**:
- Free: 800 users × €0 = €0
- Pro: 150 users × €9.99 = €1,498.50
- Enterprise: 50 users × €49.99 = €2,499.50
- **Total Monthly Revenue**: €3,998
- **R2 Storage Cost**: ~€0.56 (40GB total)
- **Net Storage Margin**: 99.99%

**Optimistic Scenario (60% free, 30% pro, 10% enterprise)**:
- Free: 600 users × €0 = €0
- Pro: 300 users × €9.99 = €2,997
- Enterprise: 100 users × €49.99 = €4,999
- **Total Monthly Revenue**: €7,996
- **R2 Storage Cost**: ~€3.36 (240GB total)
- **Net Storage Margin**: 99.96%

**Key Insight**: Storage costs remain negligible even at scale due to:
1. Zero egress fees (users query documents frequently)
2. Low R2 storage rates (€0.014/GB)
3. User quota limits prevent abuse

### 3.3 Quota Enforcement

**Current Implementation**:
- Quota tracking in database (database.py:82-83)
- Pre-upload validation in document_operations.py (to be implemented)

**Required Features**:
1. **Pre-upload check**:
   ```python
   def check_storage_quota(user_id: str, file_size: int) -> bool:
       user = get_user_by_id(user_id)
       if (user.storage_used_mb + file_size / 1024 / 1024) > user.storage_quota_mb:
           raise ValueError("Storage quota exceeded")
   ```

2. **Quota update on upload**:
   ```python
   user.storage_used_mb += file_size / 1024 / 1024
   db.commit()
   ```

3. **Quota reduction on delete**:
   ```python
   user.storage_used_mb -= doc.file_size / 1024 / 1024
   db.commit()
   ```

4. **User dashboard display**:
   - Progress bar showing storage usage
   - "Upgrade to Pro" button when approaching limit

### 3.4 Additional Revenue Streams

**Premium Features** (beyond storage):
- Priority processing (faster queue)
- Advanced AI models (GPT-4, Claude Opus)
- Custom branding (white-label)
- API access for integrations
- Batch processing capabilities
- Extended retention (free: 30 days, pro: 1 year, enterprise: unlimited)

**Usage-Based Pricing** (future):
- AI query credits (e.g., 100 free/month, then €0.10 per query)
- Video encoding minutes (free: 10 min/month, then €0.50/min)

## 4. Risk Management

### 4.1 Storage Risks

**Risk 1: Rapid User Growth**
- **Scenario**: 10,000 free users × 100MB = 1TB storage
- **Cost**: €14/month (affordable)
- **Mitigation**: Conversion funnel to paid tiers, aggressive quota limits for free tier

**Risk 2: Storage Abuse**
- **Scenario**: Users upload large files repeatedly
- **Mitigation**:
  - File size limits (free: 50MB, pro: 500MB, enterprise: 5GB)
  - Rate limiting (10 uploads/hour)
  - Automatic duplicate detection

**Risk 3: R2 Price Increase**
- **Scenario**: Cloudflare raises prices
- **Mitigation**: S3-compatible API allows migration to AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or self-hosted MinIO

**Risk 4: Data Loss**
- **Scenario**: R2 outage or data corruption
- **Mitigation**:
  - Cloudflare's 99.9% SLA
  - Daily backups to secondary provider (optional, for enterprise tier)
  - Store critical metadata in PostgreSQL (redundant backup)

### 4.2 Compliance Risks

**GDPR Compliance**:
- ✅ Europe endpoint selected
- ✅ User isolation per folder structure
- ✅ Easy data deletion (delete all files in `users/{user_id}/`)
- ✅ Data export capability (download all files via S3 API)

**Data Retention**:
- Implement automatic cleanup after 30 days (free tier)
- Enterprise tier: user-controlled retention
