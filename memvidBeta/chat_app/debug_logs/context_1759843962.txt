to that activity.

DEGREE OF ACTIVITY
We should like to present that part of our findings on the constancy 
and identity of the degree of activity referring to failures and to their 
childhood. Here we must take as our point of departure the traditional 
conception of types of failures, although we qualify all failures as cases 
of insufficient social interest. We must add that each case within a type 
shows qualitative and quantitative differences with respect to its activity.
While the degree of cooperative ability gives the direction, it is only if 
taken together with the degree of activity that this will permit us to 
predict, when there is danger of a failure, what kind of failure it will be.
A thorough knowledge of the structure of each type of failure serves 
as illumination of the field of view in which we expect to find the indi­
vidual case. We should like to classify the typical failures as follows: 
problem children, neurotics and psychotics, suicides, criminals, alco­
holics and drug addicts, sexual perverts, prostitutes.
In problem children, the difference in activity is already clear and 
should determine the correspondingly different measures of education. 
Wild, unbridled, stubborn, stealing, quarrelsome children obviously have 
a greater degree of activity than shy, reticent, frightened children, and 
those who are dependent on others.

teria, and paranoia appears understandable and well-determined. The ac­
complishments of men of genius, criminal actions, and creations of the 
folk psyche are accessible to psychological analysis and turn out to be 
comparable in their psychological structure to that of the neurotic symp­
toms. This comparability of psychological results and their surprising 
identity give us such confidence in dealing with the difficult subject of 
the theoiy of neurosis that even strong objections by qualified critics 
could not disconcert us, let alone unjustified complaints or unqualified 
rejection.
Naturally, anyone who stands for the unity and uniform structure 
of the psychoneuroses will have to explain each particular case indi­
vidually.
COMMENT In the above Adler established a common principle for all  
mental life. Although Freud had notably pointed out  
similarities between the normal and the abnormal and maintained com­
mon etiologies for diverse symptoms, he criticized Adler for going much  
too far in this direction. In  1914 Freud wrote: “Psycho-analysis has never  
claimed to provide a complete theory of  human mentality as  a whole,  
but only expected that what it offered should be applied to supplement  
and correct the knowledge  acquired by other means.

B. Love and Marriage
1. THE SOCIAL NATURE OF MARRIAGE3
If I were asked to say what love and marriage mean, I should give the 
following definition, incomplete as it may be: “Love, with its fulfill­
ment, marriage, is the most intimate devotion towards a partner of the 
other sex, expressed in physical attraction, comradeship, and the deci­
sion to have children. It can easily be shown that love and marriage are 
one side of cooperation in general, not a cooperation for the welfare of 
two persons only, but a cooperation also for the welfare of mankind.”
Our first finding in the problem of love is that it is a task for two 
individuals. For many people this is bound to be a new task. To some 
degree we have been trained to work alone; to some degree, to work in 
a group. But we have generally had little experience of working two by 
two. This new condition, therefore, raises a difficulty; but it is easier to 
solve if these two people have been interested in their fellows, for then 
they can learn more easily to be interested in each other. We may say 
that for a full solution of this cooperation of two, each partner must be 
more interested in the other than in himself. This is the only basis on 
which love and marriage can be successful.
If each partner is to be more interested in the other partner than in 
himself, there must be equality. If there is to be so intimate a devotion, 
neither partner can feel subdued nor overshadowed. Equality is only 
possible if both partners have this attitude.

each partner must be 
more interested in the other than in himself. This is the only basis on 
which love and marriage can be successful.
If each partner is to be more interested in the other partner than in 
himself, there must be equality. If there is to be so intimate a devotion, 
neither partner can feel subdued nor overshadowed. Equality is only 
possible if both partners have this attitude. It should be the effort of 
each to ease and enrich the life of the other. In this way each will be 
safe; each will feel that he is worthwhile and that he is needed. The 
fundamental guarantee of marriage, the meaning of marital happiness, 
is the feeling that you are worthwhile, that you cannot be replaced, that 
your partner needs you, that you are acting well, and that you are a 
fellow man and a true friend.
Cooperation demands a decision for eternity; and we regard only 
those unions as real examples of love and as real marriages in which a 
fixed and unalterable decision has been taken. This includes the decision 
to have children, to educate them, to train them in cooperation, and 
to make out of them, as far as we can, fellow men, equal and responsi­
ble members of the human race. A good marriage is the best means we 
have for bringing up the future generation of mankind; and marriage432 THE INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY OF ALFRED ADLER

that in doing so we have disregarded the finer differences so dear to the 
heart of the painstaking theoretician. Our justification is that we wanted 
to provide an uncomplicated introductory background.
A second expedient was to call Adler a subjective psychologist, without 
qualifying the designation sufficiently. To begin with, as we have already 
pointed out, the term stands for a whole syndrome which is certainly not 
completely homogeneous. Secondly, we must stress again that Adler’s 
particular subjectivity refers to dynamics: he was not a reductionist at­
tempting to trace dynamic forces to a physiological origin, but saw in 
ideas, which in the last analysis are the creation of the individual, the ulti­
mate determiners. Yet while his view of causality was subjectivistic, he 
combined in his method of observing the phenomenological with the ob­
jective behavioristic approach: “If we want to understand a person [that 
is, understand the hidden meaning of his introspections] we have to close 
our ears. We have only to look. In this way we can see as in a pantomime” 
(i93id, p. 25). Adler’s favorite way of expressing this principle was 
through Martin Luther’s aphorism, “not to watch a person’s mouth but 
his fists” (1913^ p. 15411.). This combination of postulating subjective 
causality with employing objective methods of observation corresponds to 
Adler’s philosophic position as an idealistic positivist.

COMMENT The reader may be surprised to find a drive to see,  a drive 
to smell,  a drive to hear; in other words, to End the sen­
sory functions understood as having dynamic qualities. This view, how­
ever, has relatively recently been taken up by Robert S. Woodworth  
in a paper on perception in which he states: “Perception is always driven  
by a direct, inherent motive which might be called the will to  perceive. 
Whatever ulterior motives may be  present from time to time, this direct  
perceptual motive is always present in any use of the senses” (121, p. 123). 
The recent  general textbook by Gardner Murphy  also takes this position.  
“Every part of the body has its own tensions, its own activities, and there­
fore contributes directly or indirectly to the ongoing flow of bodily re­
sponse which  we call motivation . . . When the sense organs are stimu­
lated and the brain is aroused, our response is frequently one of delight,  
excitement, interest. The tiny child and the tiny animal are strongly  
drawn toward certain sights, sounds, smells, touches, warm things, cold  
things . . . Such activities might be called sensory drives, arising from  
sensory tension systems”  (83, p.

56THE INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY OF ALFRED ADLER
c. Critique of Freud’s Concept of Sexuality (1911)
COMMENT  In approximately 1902, Adler had become  an active member 
of Freud’s circle.  According to Bottome,  “an article ap­
peared  in the Neue Freie Presse holding Freud’s new book [on Dream 
Analysis] up to ridicule.” Adler, who did not know  Freud personally at 
the time, came to his defense with a strongly written reply to the criticism,  
published in the same newspaper.  Thereupon Freud sent him a  postcard 
“thanking him for his defense, and  asking him to join the discussion circle  
of psychoanalysis”  (15, pp. 56~57)-
There is  much evidence to show that Adler’s association with  Freud 
became a very close one.  Again according to Bottome , Freud  turned over 
many of his patients to Adler. “Adler was as well Freud’s own  personal 
doctor, and a highly  valued one, as their early  correspondence shows” 
(15, p. 64). Several  years later Adler  became president of the  recently 
founded Vienna Psychoanalytic Society  (36, 1, p. 338) and, together with  
Wilhelm Stekel, editor of the Erst  psychoanalytic journal, the  Zentral- 
blatt fur Psychoanalyse. All this is of interest in itself, but especially  in 
the present connection, because it shows that when Adler now became  
Freud’s critic, he was well  qualified.

founded Vienna Psychoanalytic Society  (36, 1, p. 338) and, together with  
Wilhelm Stekel, editor of the Erst  psychoanalytic journal, the  Zentral- 
blatt fur Psychoanalyse. All this is of interest in itself, but especially  in 
the present connection, because it shows that when Adler now became  
Freud’s critic, he was well  qualified. His understanding of psychoanalysis  
was probably second only to Freud’s.
When the difference in theory between Adler and Freud had become  
acute, the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, of which Adler was then presi­
dent,  decided to hear  a comprehensive presentation of his theories, which  
the members could  discuss at length. Adler read three  papers in the course  
of these meetings, the last on  February 1, 1911 (24, pp. 230-231). Selec­
tions from these papers, as found in  Heilen und Bilden, are presented in 
this and in the next two sections. This series of addresses represented the  
culmination of a development which led to Adler’s resignation from his  
psychoanalytic offices and his complete separation from Freud.
1. LIMITATION OF THE SEX DRIVE10
It is idle to ask whether a neurosis is possible without inclusion of the 
sex drive. After all, it has a similarly great significance in the life of 
everyone. The real question is whether the beginning and the end and all 
the symptom formations of the neurosis are to be found in the fate of the

steps beyond the present, that is, temporally beyond the limits of primitive 
drive-satisfaction. Here increased tensions are as urgent as repressions. In 
these relations [to the culture] rests the necessity for an extensive system 
of safeguards, one small part of which we must recognize in the neurosis.
These tensions begin on the first day of infancy and change all bodily 
and psychological tendencies to such an extent that, for example, what we 
see never represents something original or primary, something that has 
not been influenced, or something that has become changed only at a 
later time. Instead, the adaptation of the child directs and modifies the 
drives until he has adjusted himself in some way to the environment. In 
this first stage of life, one cannot speak of a permanent model nor of 
identification when the child orients himself by a model. For this is often 
the only way for immediate drive satisfaction.
If we consider the varied manner and tempo in which the satisfaction 
of drives has asserted itself everywhere and at all times, and how much it 
has depended on social institutions and economic conditions, we arrive 
at a conclusion which is analogous to the above, namely, that drive- 
satisfaction, and consequently the quality and strength of the drive, are 
at all times variable and therefore not measurable [with regard to their 
original condition].

of drives has asserted itself everywhere and at all times, and how much it 
has depended on social institutions and economic conditions, we arrive 
at a conclusion which is analogous to the above, namely, that drive- 
satisfaction, and consequently the quality and strength of the drive, are 
at all times variable and therefore not measurable [with regard to their 
original condition]. In the talk on “Sexuality and Neurosis,” I likewise 
came to the conclusion, based on observations regarding the sex drive 
of neurotics, that the apparently libidinous and sexual tendencies in the 
neurotic, as in the normal individual, in no way permit any conclusion 
regarding the strength or composition of his sex drive.
2. VALUES IN PLACE OF PLEASURE17
How then does the adaptation of a child to a given family environment 
take place? Let us recall how diversely the expressions of the child’s or­
ganism shape themselves, even during the first months when it is still 
most possible to attain an over-all view. Some children can never get 
enough to eat, others are quite moderate; some refuse changes in diet, 
others want to eat everything. The same is true with regard to seeing, 
hearing, excretion, bathing, and relations to other persons of the environ­
ment. Yet already during the first days the child feels reassured if we take 
him into our arms. Educational influences which smooth the way for the 
child are of far-reaching significance here.
Already these first adaptations contain affective values in relation to 
the persons of the environment.
