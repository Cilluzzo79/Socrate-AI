Amandine	told	me	her	story	when	we	first	met	in	2014,	at	an	event	I	was
hosting	for	the	spiritual	figure	Amma,	known	as	
the	“hugging	saint.”	It	turned
out	that	her	friend’s	aunt	would	be	at	the	book	festival,	and	the	aunt	was	best
friends	with	Ella	Maillart.	Maillart	was	a	renowned	Swiss	adventurer	and
photographer	who	had	undertaken	the	kinds	of	extraordinary	journeys	that
Amandine’s	heart	longed	to	experience.	Maillart	was	best	known	for	traveling
3,500	miles	across	China	with	
Times	of	London
	correspondent	Peter	Fleming	in
1935,	traversing	inhospitable	deserts	and	treacherous	passes	of	the	Himalayas	by
train,	truck,	yak,	and	camel	and	on	foot.	She	had	also	traveled	from	Geneva	to
Kabul	by	car	in	1939	and	spent	time	with	nomads	in	Kyrgyzstan.	Amandine	said
to	herself,	“This	is	the	life	I	want	to	have.”
Her	friend’s	aunt	gave	her	Maillart’s	number	to	set	up	an	appointment	to
meet.	While	Amandine	was	preparing	for	the	interview	and	getting	to	know
Maillart’s	work,	Maillart,	who	was	n

In	the	chaos	that	ensued	following	the	attacks	on	the	World	Trade	Center,

who	had	allowed	her	to	complete	her	quest	and	repay	him.	More	than	ten	years
later,	in	2012,	a	friend	of	Amandine	called	her	from	France.	By	this	time,
Amandine	had	been	living	in	Afghanistan	on	and	off	for	the	last	decade	in
service	to	the	Afghan	people.	The	friend	was	writing	a	book	on	a	famous
Pashtun	woman	and	asked	if	Amandine	could	invite	the	woman	to	her	house	to
assist	her	with	the	book	contract.	Amandine	agreed,	and	her	friend	sent	a
translator	who	turned	out	to	be	a	translator	for	the	Taliban.	“Really?”	asked
Amandine.	“Do	you	know	Habibullah?”	The	man	laughed.	“Why	are	you
laughing?”	she	asked.	“Because	you	are	his	neighbor.	He	lives	on	the	corner	of
your	street.”	Amandine	had	been	in	Afghanistan	for	ten	years	and	had	no	
idea	if
Habibullah	was	even	still	alive,	and	in	fact	he	was	living	just	down	the	street.
The	translator	called	Habibullah	and	said,	“Habibullah,	salaam	aleikum.	I	have	a
surprise	for	you.”
And	Habibullah	answered,	“Is	it	Amanuddin?”
Habibullah,	it	turned	ou

,	to	rejoin	broken	ceramics	but	transformed	the
appearance	of	the	seam	by	sprinkling	gold	dust	into	the	lacquer.	This	was	the
origin	of	the	technique	of	kintsugi,	or	“golden	joinery.”	Rather	than	attempting
to	hide	the	previous	damage,	kintsugi	not	only	accepts	the	crack	but	highlights	it,
allowing	us	to	appreciate	the	history	of	the	object	as	part	of	its	beauty.	What	may
have	ended	up	in	the	garbage	has	been	transmuted	into	a	stronger	and	more
unique	work	of	art.
Whether	this	legend	is	true	or	not,	kintsugi	contains	a	profound	teaching	on
how	to	reframe	our	so-called	mistakes,	as	well	as	the	inevitable	knocks,	breaks,
and	cracks	that	come	with	living	an	engaged	life.	Kintsugi	is	part	of	a	Japanese
philosophical	tradition	that	includes	wabi-sabi,	the	practice	of	consciously
valuing	marks	of	wear	from	an	object’s	use	in	order	to	embrace	what	is	flawed
and	imperfect.	At	the	core	of	wabi-sabi	is	the	humble	understanding	and
realization	that	we	are	ourselves	incomplete,	impermanent,	and	limited	by	being
bound	in	time.	That	is	the	nature	of	our	existence,	and	its	denial	further	creates
suffering.	When	we	accept	this	reality,	it	allows	us	to	move	forward	without	fear.

t	by	all	the	harsh	evidence	that	almost	all	of	my
dreams	had	failed.	As	I	drove	up,	I	saw	the	garden	my	wife	had	planted	with
such	enthusiasm	and	care.	What	had	once	grown	was	now	wilted	and	dead.
Yellow-leaved	azaleas	and	drooping	camellias	
betrayed	the	lack	of	attention	the
garden	had	been	getting	from	the	gardener	who	had	promised	to	check	in.	The
house	looked	abandoned.
What	hurt	most	was	who	was	absent	from	the	house.	Throughout	the	rooms
were	nails	or	picture	hooks	screwed	into	the	walls,	but	without	pictures.	When
my	wife	left,	she	took	all	the	family	photographs,	and	with	them,	any	reminder
that	a	family	had	lived	in	this	house.	In	the	central	living	room,	above	the
mantel,	there	was	a	rectangular	sun-shadow	and	a	hook	where	a	framed	picture
had	hung.	This	had	been	our	prized	botanical	print	of	iris	bulbs	by	the	Bavarian
master	Basilius	Besler,	which	we	had	discovered	in	a	tucked-away	antiquarian
print	shop	in	Florence	on	one	of	our	print-hunting	adventures.
Those	were	happier	times.	At	the	same	store,	we	found	a	number	of	old	maps
from	the	sixteenth	and	seventeenth	centuries	that	we	loved	and	that	I	bought.	I
remembered	feeling	happy	at	the	time,	and	that	I	was	making	her

And	when	we	picture	a	mansion	to	live	in,	we	see	a	warm	and	vibrant	scene	of
family	life.	We	do	not	imagine	our	family	fractured	by	a	lack	of	intimacy,	and
ourselves	alone	facing	the	sale	of	our	home.	We	imagine	the	things	we	want,	but
not	the	complexities	they	bring.	We	imagine	the	widow’s	walk,	but	not	the

a	clear	head	and	an	
open	heart.	What	had	worked	and	what	hadn’t?	What	was
