e	of	agency	may	be	present	even	when	physical	agency	is
not.	As	a	neurosurgeon,	I	have	seen	many	patients,	either	due	to	disease	or
trauma,	with	a	condition	known	as	
anosognosia
.	
Anosognosia
	comes	from	the
Greek	words	
nosos
	(“disease”)	and	
gnosis
	(“knowledge”),	so	patients	with
anosognosia	do	not	know	or	realize	they	have	a	particular	disease	or	impairment.
One	example	is	hemiplegia,	which	describes	patients	who	are	paralyzed,	usually
following	a	stroke.	If	the	stroke	also	affects	those	areas	of	the	brain	associated

the	highest	mountain	peak	on	an	island.	At	over	sixteen	thousand	feet,	it	is	one
of	the	Seven	Summits,	the	highest	mountains	on	each	of	the	seven	traditional
continents.	It	was	2015,	and	Puncak	Jaya	was	the	fifth	summit	Silvia	had
climbed,	having	undertaken	Kilimanjaro	in	Tanzania,	Mount	Elbrus	in	Russia,
Aconcagua	in	Argentina,	and	Mount	Kosciuszko	in	Australia.
The	climbs	were	not	just	recreational;	they	had	a	profound	symbolic	meaning
for	Silvia.	Growing	up	in	Lima,	Peru,	Silvia	was	a	victim	of	childhood	sexual
abuse.	The	trauma	of	her	abuse	and	her	family’s	silence	around	it	left	deep
emotional	and	psychic	wounds.	In	her	twenties,	the	pain	led	her	into	a	spiral	of
serious	depression,	alcoholism,	and	broken	relationships	with	women	that	held
her	life	captive	as	she	concealed	her	sexuality	from	her	family.	Even	though	she
achieved	success	amidst	the	male-dominated	posturing	of	the	high-tech	Silicon
Valley	world,	she	knew	the	untended	wounds	of	her	past	were	threatening	to
swallow	her	up.	Finally,	out	of	desperation,	she	accepted	her	mother’s	invitation
in	2005	to	return	to	Peru	to	participate	in	an	ayahuasca	ceremony	during	which
she	had	a	transformative	vision:	her	younge

[Sezione: ience.	The	brain	examines	whether	our	actions] [Sezione 5 di 19]

ience.	The	brain	examines	whether	our	actions
appear	to	be	causing	the	results	we	intend	them	to	and	influencing	our
environment	as	we	choose,	and	then	uses	that	data	to	assess	whether	we	have
agency	in	the	situation.	The	humbling	truth	is	that	our	conscious	mind	does	not
have	access	to	most	of	the	subconscious	
processes	by	which	we	carry	out	actions
(such	as	our	ability	to	perform	movements),	and	therefore	it	can	only	set	an
intention,	watch	its	effects,	and	then	interpret	them	accordingly.	In	other	words,
our	sense	of	agency	is	a	
story
	our	brain	tells	us	about	our	experience.	When	the
story	the	brain	tells	us	is	that	we	do	not	have	the	power	to	perform	the	actions
necessary	to	influence	our	circumstances	for	the	better,	we	feel	disheartened	and
lose	our	motivation;	when	the	story	tells	us	we	do	have	the	capacity	to	act	on	our
desires,	we	feel	empowered,	confident,	and	integrated.
To	illustrate	the	interpretive	nature	of	agency,	we	can	examine	the	surprising
science	of	how	the	sense	of	agency	may	be	present	even	when	physical	agency	is
not.	As	a	neurosurgeon,	I	have	seen	many	patients,	either	due	to	disease	or

,	to	rejoin	broken	ceramics	but	transformed	the
appearance	of	the	seam	by	sprinkling	gold	dust	into	the	lacquer.	This	was	the
origin	of	the	technique	of	kintsugi,	or	“golden	joinery.”	Rather	than	attempting
to	hide	the	previous	damage,	kintsugi	not	only	accepts	the	crack	but	highlights	it,
allowing	us	to	appreciate	the	history	of	the	object	as	part	of	its	beauty.	What	may
have	ended	up	in	the	garbage	has	been	transmuted	into	a	stronger	and	more
unique	work	of	art.
Whether	this	legend	is	true	or	not,	kintsugi	contains	a	profound	teaching	on
how	to	reframe	our	so-called	mistakes,	as	well	as	the	inevitable	knocks,	breaks,
and	cracks	that	come	with	living	an	engaged	life.	Kintsugi	is	part	of	a	Japanese
philosophical	tradition	that	includes	wabi-sabi,	the	practice	of	consciously
valuing	marks	of	wear	from	an	object’s	use	in	order	to	embrace	what	is	flawed
and	imperfect.	At	the	core	of	wabi-sabi	is	the	humble	understanding	and
realization	that	we	are	ourselves	incomplete,	impermanent,	and	limited	by	being
bound	in	time.	That	is	the	nature	of	our	existence,	and	its	denial	further	creates
suffering.	When	we	accept	this	reality,	it	allows	us	to	move	forward	without	fear.
