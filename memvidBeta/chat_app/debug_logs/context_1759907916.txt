THE	SUBCONSCIOUS


## Pagina 131

In	terms	of	the	mind,	most	would	argue	that	we	have	a	conscious,	a
subconscious	(or	preconscious),	and	an	unconscious.	
The	automatic	parts	of	our
nervous	system,	composed	of	the	subconscious	and	unconscious,	represent	a	part
of	our	mind	below	our	conscious	awareness.	We	discussed	previously	the	image
of	the	mind	as	an	iceberg,	with	the	conscious	mind	(what	we	are	aware	of	in
ordinary	waking	consciousness)	representing	that	which	is	above	the	water	and
constituting	less	than	10	percent	of	the	mind,	while	the	subconscious	and
unconscious	make	up	the	remaining	90	percent	hidden	below	the	surface	of	
the
water.	At	its	simplest,	the	conscious	mind	means	having	awareness	of	internal
and	external	existence.	This	awareness	is	based	on	the	five	senses,	the	qualia
(the	subjective	interpretation	of	the	senses),	and	the	conscious	access	to	memory
and	prior	experience.	Today,	the	definition	often	includes	any	kind	of	feeling,
cognition,	or	perception.

e	of	agency	may	be	present	even	when	physical	agency	is
not.	As	a	neurosurgeon,	I	have	seen	many	patients,	either	due	to	disease	or
trauma,	with	a	condition	known	as	
anosognosia

Anosognosia
	comes	from	the
Greek	words	
nosos
	(“disease”)	and	
gnosis
	(“knowledge”),	so	patients	with
anosognosia	do	not	know	or	realize	they	have	a	particular	disease	or	impairment.
One	example	is	hemiplegia,	which	describes	patients	who	are	paralyzed,	usually

mmentator	that
provides	detailed	thoughts	on	our	performance.
One	of	the	most	treacherous	mental	phenomena	is	the	habitual	negative	self-
talk	we	call	the	“inner	critic.”	From	a	neuroscientific	perspective,	the	inner	critic
can	be	seen	as	an	unfortunate	collaboration	between	the	default	mode	network
and	the	SNS.	When	the	DMN	gets	hooked	by	the	stress	response	of	the	SNS,	we
experience	the	sort	of	incapacitating	self-consciousness	that	kept	Anula
paralyzed.	Crucially	for	our	purposes,	the	DMN	is	negatively	correlated	with	the
attention	network	(AN),	meaning	that	the	more	it	is	activated,	the	less	access	we
have	to	the	power	of	our	attention.	The	practices	in	this	book	are	designed	in	part
to	diminish	the	overpowering	sense	of	self-consciousness	that	the	DMN
contributes	to	our	“inner	critic.”
The	DMN	has	two	powerful	lessons	for	us	in	manifesting:	first,	experiences
such	as	mind-wandering	illustrate	that	cognition	is	not	always	tethered	to	events
in	the	here	and	now.	As	we	practice,	we	will	learn	to	intentionally	detach	our
awareness	from	whatever	is	happening	in	our	five	senses	and	direct	it	toward	an
imagined	experience	of	the	future	we	envision.	Second,	when	our	mind	wanders,

the	senses),	and	the	conscious	access	to	memory
and	prior	experience.	Today,	the	definition	often	includes	any	kind	of	feeling,
cognition,	or	perception.
On	a	conscious	level,	we	can	sense	events	around	us,	interactions	with	others,
sensory	input	that	is	necessary	to	process	for	survival,	events	occurring	right
now.	Yet	there	are	myriad	events	that	typically	occur	automatically	and	that	are
not	noted	on	a	conscious	level,	such	as	control	of	body	temperature,	heart	rate,
release	of	hormones,	or	other	factors	important	to	maintaining	the	homeostatic
control	of	the	body	itself	(autonomic	processes).	These	mechanisms	have
evolved	over	millions	of	years.
Although	we	may	not	be	conscious	of	it,	that	huge	90	percent	of	the	iceberg
under	the	water	exerts	a	powerful	influence	on	our	behavior.	Thus,	the
subconscious	is	working	around	the	clock,	taking	care	of	us	and	making	many
decisions	automatically.	On	some	level,	we	are	consciously	aware	that	there	are
vast	and	complex	processes	churning	away	below	the	surface,	but	our	experience
of	it	is	that	we	are	often	surprised	by	its	workings.	The	subconscious	can	seem
strange,	magical,	and	even	frightening	because	we	are	not	seeing	how	it	is

d	attention.	CEN	hypoactivity	is	associated	with	depression	and
a	variety	of	cognitive	disorders.
We	need	the	CEN	to	help	us	make	wise	and	appropriate	practical	decisions,
but	we	also	need	it	for	the	top-down	processing	that	is	necessary	to	regulate	our
emotions.	When	Anula	was	overwhelmed	by	stress	and	doubt,	she	lost	her
ability	to	keep	her	feelings	in	perspective,	reframe	them,	redirect	her	attention	to
her	goals,	and	talk	herself	down	from	the	state	of	chronic	SNS	activation.	When
it	is	operating	correctly,	the	CEN	resembles	the	grounded	and	stable	adult	who
can	soothe	the	childlike	nervous	system	and	defuse	its	tantrum.	This
psychological	and	emotional	stability	will	be	essential	when	we	seek	to	embed
our	intention	in	our	subconscious,	which	requires	a	mental	state	of	calm,	ease,
and	steadiness.
HOW	THEY	WORK	TOGETHER
To	manifest	with	maximum	power,	the	four	networks	must	collaborate
effectively	in	an	elegant	interplay.
When	the	process	is	running	smoothly,	the	SN	works	in	tandem	with	the	AN
to	determine	that	a	stimulus—in	this	case,	our	desired	intention—requires	higher
cognitive	processing.	This	interaction	then	activates	the	CEN	and	deactivates	the
