we	make,	the	higher	the	walls	get	and	the	darker	it	becomes.	In	fact,	the	walls
start	coming	in	on	us	as	we	believe	every	negative	thing	we	are	told	about
ourselves,	and	by	doing	so	we	give	up	our	agency	to	manifest	change.	We	have
given	it	all	away	to	this	voice	that	we	thought	meant	something	when	it	did	not
mean	anything	at	all.	We	have	given	away	our	power	to	that	inner	critic.
As	an	example,	I	was	giving	a	lecture	on	impostor	syndrome	to	a	group	of
healthcare	executives,	and	a	woman	in	her	fifties	stood	up.	She	was	crying.	In	a
trembling	voice,	she	said,	“My	father	told	me	I	would	never	be	anything	and	I
had	to	prove	him	wrong.”	She	is	now	an	RN	with	a	PhD	in	nursing	and	in	an
executive	position,	yet	her	father’s	words	had	hung	over	her	throughout	her
entire	life.	Such	a	negative	childhood	experience	can	indeed	be	a	strong	driver	of
our	behavior,	but	it	is	often	a	painful,	unhealthy	one.	This	is	the	power	of	these
negative	narratives	that	get	embedded	in	our	heads.	Think	of	how	many	people
are	destroyed	by	such	statements	and	never	live	up	to	their	potential.	Some	of	us
carry	these	negative	stories	our	entire	lives,	achieving	a	“successful”	career	yet
feeling	empty	and	unfulfi

us.	We	do	not	imagine	the	pain	of	having	no	one	to	share	our	adventure	with.
And	when	we	picture	a	mansion	to	live	in,	we	see	a	warm	and	vibrant	scene	of
family	life.	We	do	not	imagine	our	family	fractured	by	a	lack	of	intimacy,	and
ourselves	alone	facing	the	sale	of	our	home.	We	imagine	the	things	we	want,	but
not	the	complexities	they	bring.	We	imagine	the	widow’s	walk,	but	not	the
possums.
Before	I	could	think	about	what	I	wanted	to	manifest	in	the	next	stage	of	my
life,	I	had	to	understand	what	I	had	
already
	manifested,	and	assess	its	value	with
a	clear	head	and	an	
open	heart.	What	had	worked	and	what	hadn’t?	What	was
my	role	in	manifesting	the	empty	mansion,	the	broken	family,	the	dead	end?
How	had	my	thinking,	my	unexamined	beliefs,	and	my	unfinished	business	with
my	heart	contributed	to	this	quagmire?
PRACTICE:	
What	Am	I	Already	Manifesting?
In	this	practice,	I	invite	you	to	assess	your	current	situation	with	clarity	and

who	practiced	an	attitude	of	“long-term	nonspecific	optimism.”	He	did	not	know
if	or	when	he	would	be	liberated	and	he	recognized	that	his	situation	was	outside
of	his	control:	to	fight	his	captors	was	to	possibly	be	killed	or	to	lose	the	will	to
live	from	despair.	Instead,	his	conscious	practice	of	optimism	allowed	him	to
remain	hopeful	that	his	circumstances	could	change.	He	used	the	power	of	his
mind	to	keep	his	belief	in	the	possibility	of	freedom	alive.	It	gave	him	resilience.
And	when	he	was	released,	his	attitude	of	optimism	helped	him	not	to	focus	on
the	past	but	to	look	forward	to	future	possibilities.
Thus	I	see	manifesting	as,	at	its	heart,	a	practice	of	well-being,	engagement

head	in	my	hands,	I	learned	firsthand	this	was	untrue.	In	fact,	there	is	nothing
about	manifesting	that	is	inherently	about	acquiring	material	possessions.	In	a
sense,	to	envision	and	seek	only	material	gain	is	to	dream	too	small.	I	now	find	it
ironic	that	when	my	twelve-year-old	self	imagined	an	island,	it	was	to	be	private,
all	mine,	its	luxury	a	testament	to	my	personal	glory	alone;	when	Nainoa
Thompson	imagined	Tahiti,	it	held	a	deep	symbolic	meaning	not	only	for	himself
but	for	his	entire	community	and	his	lineage.	Both	of	us	imagined	islands,	but
they	were	very	different	destinations.
Knowing	clearly	what	we	truly	want	will	allow	us	to	set	our	inner	compass	in
the	right	direction;	it	will	be	the	basis	for	the	intention	we	will	consciously

Where	some	may	believe	that	the	only	measure	of	a	successful	manifestation	is

Christine	Wamsler	is	a	professor	at	Lund	University	in	Sweden.	She	is	an
expert	in	sustainable	development	and	associated	inner-outer	transformation
processes.	She	argues	that	by	tracing	the	roots	of	sustainability	crises	such	as
climate	change	through	a	culturally	entrenched	story	of	separateness,	we	can	see
the	potential	of	inner	transformation	through	meditation	and	the	development	of
compassion	both	for	self	and	others,	which	then	fosters	outer	connection	and
transformation	in	the	world.	Christine	and	I	became	connected	when	I	joined	the
advisory	board	for	several	projects	of	the	Contemplative	Sustainable	Futures
Program.
Through	personal	explorations	involving	both	visualization	and	meditation,
she	experienced	firsthand	the	importance	of	creating	positive	emotions.	For
several	years,	her	inner	drive	and	goal	was	to	relieve	suffering	and	support	a
more	sustainable	and	just	world	through	a	scientific	understanding	of	the	mind.
Unfortunately,	her	inner	transformation	was	hampered	by
