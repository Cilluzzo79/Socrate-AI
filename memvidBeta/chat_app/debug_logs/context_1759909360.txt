e	of	agency	may	be	present	even	when	physical	agency	is
not.	As	a	neurosurgeon,	I	have	seen	many	patients,	either	due	to	disease	or
trauma,	with	a	condition	known	as	
anosognosia
.	
Anosognosia
	comes	from	the
Greek	words	
nosos
	(“disease”)	and	
gnosis
	(“knowledge”),	so	patients	with
anosognosia	do	not	know	or	realize	they	have	a	particular	disease	or	impairment.
One	example	is	hemiplegia,	which	describes	patients	who	are	paralyzed,	usually
following	a	stroke.	If	the	stroke	also	affects	those	areas	of	the	brain	associated

[Sezione: ience.	The	brain	examines	whether	our	actions] [Sezione 5 di 19]

ience.	The	brain	examines	whether	our	actions
appear	to	be	causing	the	results	we	intend	them	to	and	influencing	our
environment	as	we	choose,	and	then	uses	that	data	to	assess	whether	we	have
agency	in	the	situation.	The	humbling	truth	is	that	our	conscious	mind	does	not
have	access	to	most	of	the	subconscious	
processes	by	which	we	carry	out	actions
(such	as	our	ability	to	perform	movements),	and	therefore	it	can	only	set	an
intention,	watch	its	effects,	and	then	interpret	them	accordingly.	In	other	words,
our	sense	of	agency	is	a	
story
	our	brain	tells	us	about	our	experience.	When	the
story	the	brain	tells	us	is	that	we	do	not	have	the	power	to	perform	the	actions
necessary	to	influence	our	circumstances	for	the	better,	we	feel	disheartened	and
lose	our	motivation;	when	the	story	tells	us	we	do	have	the	capacity	to	act	on	our
desires,	we	feel	empowered,	confident,	and	integrated.
To	illustrate	the	interpretive	nature	of	agency,	we	can	examine	the	surprising
science	of	how	the	sense	of	agency	may	be	present	even	when	physical	agency	is
not.	As	a	neurosurgeon,	I	have	seen	many	patients,	either	due	to	disease	or

ive	flow	state.
When	our	brain	stops	believing	it	is	important	for	us	to	see	chances	to	change
our	behavior	or	environment	for	the	better,	we	feel	
stuck,	frustrated,	and
hopeless;	we	lose	sight	of	our	own	inner	power.
And	yet,	the	feeling	of	having	lost	or	been	deprived	of	our	power	does	not
mean	that	it	is	gone.	
The	sense	of	agency	is	part	of	how	the	brain	narrates	its
experiences,	often	deriving	more	from	subjective	interpretation	than	actual	fact.
We	may	
feel
	we	have	no	agency,	it	may	have	been	suppressed	or	obscured,	but	it
has	never	left	us.	It	is	a	fundamental	fact	of	being	human;	as	long	as	we	have
functioning	brains	capable	of	growth,	we	have	agency.	Therefore,	you	could	say
that	in	our	society	we	are	suffering	not	from	a	crisis	of	agency,	but	from	a	crisis

ilities	of	a	given	situation.	There	may	be	a	large
gap	between	a	person’s	feeling	of	inner	power	and	their	ability	to	express	that
power	in	practice.	In	a	sense,	many	of	us	suffer	from	the	opposite	of	the	patients
with	anosognosia:	we	labor	under	the	delusion	that	we	are	paralyzed,	when	we
are	in	fact	fully	able	to	act	effectively!
In	psychology,	
self-efficacy
	is	the	belief	of	an	individual	in	their	capacity	to
act	in	the	ways	that	are	necessary	to	achieve	their	goals.	Self-efficacy	may
influence	how	and	why	individuals	choose	to	participate	in	or	stick	with	an
activity,	and	it	is	believed	to	be	a	more	accurate	predictor	of	behavior	than	a
person’s	actual	ability.

ortunities	to	realize	his	goals.	Evidence	confirming	the
cruelty,	randomness,	and	injustice	of	the	world	became	less	relevant	to	his	mind
and	made	way	for	hopeful	indications	of	success,	synchronicities	that	advanced
his	professional	dreams,	and	perseverance	in	the	face	of	inevitable	setbacks.
Carrey	combined	the	sense	of	empowerment,	gratitude,	and	joy	he	received
from	his	visualizations	(and	the	neurotransmitters	released	by	these	experiences
of	strong	positive	emotions)	with	the	fierce	work	ethic	he	demonstrated	in
refining	his	gifts	at	the	comedy	clubs.	The	positive	emotions	he	lived	through	in
his	mental	rehearsal	signaled	to	his	brain	that	the	experiences	he	desired	were
worthy	of	attention	and	that	mental	resources	should	be	devoted	to	pursuing
them.	In	a	sense,	he	was	hypnotizing	himself	
out
	of	the	grasp	his	painful
childhood	experiences	exercised	over	him	and	
into
	the	new	reality	of	his	future

with	integration	of	self-awareness,	these	patients	may	be	unaware	on	a	conscious
level	that	their	movements	are	impaired.
Researchers	at	the	University	of	Turin	examining	such	patients	made	a
surprising	discovery.	One	woman	presented	severe	and	persistent	anosognosia
for	the	paralysis	on	her	left	side.	She	never	spontaneously	reported	her	motor
problems.	When	questioned	about	her	left	arm,	she	always	claimed	that	it	could
move	without	any	problem.	When	asked	to	actually	perform	movements	with	it,
she	attempted	to	perform	the	action,	and	after	a	few	seconds	she	appeared	to	be
satisfied	with	her	performance.	This	woman	experienced	a	sense	of	agency	for
movements	she	was	unable	to	make.	Despite	all	evidence	to	the	contrary,	she
truly	believed	she	was	able	to	move	her	paralyzed	arm.	The	researchers
concluded	that	the	experience	of	agency	in	patients	like	these	is	strongly
governed	by	cues	in	the	brain	that	precede	movement,	such	as	intentions	and
predictions	of	action,	
not
