not.	As	a	neurosurgeon,	I	have	seen	many	patients,	either	due	to	disease	or
trauma,	with	a	condition	known	as	
anosognosia

Anosognosia
	comes	from	the
Greek	words	
nosos
	(“disease”)	and	
gnosis
	(“knowledge”),	so	patients	with
anosognosia	do	not	know	or	realize	they	have	a	particular	disease	or	impairment.
One	example	is	hemiplegia,	which	describes	patients	who	are	paralyzed,	usually
following	a	stroke.	If	the	stroke	also	affects	those	areas	of	the	brain	associated

with	integration	of	self-awareness,	these	patients	may	be	unaware	on	a	conscious
level	that	their	movements	are	impaired.
Researchers	at	the	University	of	Turin	examining	such	patients	made	a
surprising	discovery.	One	woman	presented	severe	and	persistent	anosognosia
for	the	paralysis	on	her	left	side.	She	never	spontaneously	reported	her	motor
problems.	When	questioned	about	her	left	arm,	she	always	claimed	that	it	could
move	without	any	problem.	When	asked	to	actually	perform	movements	with	it,
she	attempted	to	perform	the	action,	and	after	a	few	seconds	she	appeared	to	be
satisfied	with	her	performance.	This	woman	experienced	a	sense	of	agency	for
movements	she	was	unable	to	make.	Despite	all	evidence	to	the	contrary,	she
truly	believed	she	was	able	to	move	her	paralyzed	arm.	The	researchers
concluded	that	the	experience	of	agency	in	patients	like	these	is	strongly
governed	by	cues	in	the	brain	that	precede	movement,	such	as	intentions	and
predictions	of	action,	
not
	the	actual	act

ience.	The	brain	examines	whether	our	actions
appear	to	be	causing	the	results	we	intend	them	to	and	influencing	our
environment	as	we	choose,	and	then	uses	that	data	to	assess	whether	we	have
agency	in	the	situation.	The	humbling	truth	is	that	our	conscious	mind	does	not
have	access	to	most	of	the	subconscious	
processes	by	which	we	carry	out	actions
(such	as	our	ability	to	perform	movements),	and	therefore	it	can	only	set	an
intention,	watch	its	effects,	and	then	interpret	them	accordingly.	In	other	words,
our	sense	of	agency	is	a	
story
	our	brain	tells	us	about	our	experience.	When	the
story	the	brain	tells	us	is	that	we	do	not	have	the	power	to	perform	the	actions
necessary	to	influence	our	circumstances	for	the	better,	we	feel	disheartened	and
lose	our	motivation;	when	the	story	tells	us	we	do	have	the	capacity	to	act	on	our
desires,	we	feel	empowered,	confident,	and	integrated.
To	illustrate	the	interpretive	nature	of	agency,	we	can	examine	the	surprising
science	of	how	the	sense	of	agency	may	be	present	even	when	physical	agency	is
not.	As	a	neurosurgeon,	I	have	seen	many	patients,	either	due	to	disease	or
trauma,	with	a	condition	known	as
