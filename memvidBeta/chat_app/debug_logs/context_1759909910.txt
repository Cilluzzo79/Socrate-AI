e	of	agency	may	be	present	even	when	physical	agency	is
not.	As	a	neurosurgeon,	I	have	seen	many	patients,	either	due	to	disease	or
trauma,	with	a	condition	known	as	
anosognosia
.	
Anosognosia
	comes	from	the
Greek	words	
nosos
	(“disease”)	and	
gnosis
	(“knowledge”),	so	patients	with
anosognosia	do	not	know	or	realize	they	have	a	particular	disease	or	impairment.
One	example	is	hemiplegia,	which	describes	patients	who	are	paralyzed,	usually
following	a	stroke.	If	the	stroke	also	affects	those	areas	of	the	brain	associated

ilities	of	a	given	situation.	There	may	be	a	large
gap	between	a	person’s	feeling	of	inner	power	and	their	ability	to	express	that
power	in	practice.	In	a	sense,	many	of	us	suffer	from	the	opposite	of	the	patients
with	anosognosia:	we	labor	under	the	delusion	that	we	are	paralyzed,	when	we
are	in	fact	fully	able	to	act	effectively!
In	psychology,	
self-efficacy
	is	the	belief	of	an	individual	in	their	capacity	to
act	in	the	ways	that	are	necessary	to	achieve	their	goals.	Self-efficacy	may
influence	how	and	why	individuals	choose	to	participate	in	or	stick	with	an
activity,	and	it	is	believed	to	be	a	more	accurate	predictor	of	behavior	than	a
person’s	actual	ability.

with	integration	of	self-awareness,	these	patients	may	be	unaware	on	a	conscious
level	that	their	movements	are	impaired.
Researchers	at	the	University	of	Turin	examining	such	patients	made	a
surprising	discovery.	One	woman	presented	severe	and	persistent	anosognosia
for	the	paralysis	on	her	left	side.	She	never	spontaneously	reported	her	motor
problems.	When	questioned	about	her	left	arm,	she	always	claimed	that	it	could
move	without	any	problem.	When	asked	to	actually	perform	movements	with	it,
she	attempted	to	perform	the	action,	and	after	a	few	seconds	she	appeared	to	be
satisfied	with	her	performance.	This	woman	experienced	a	sense	of	agency	for
movements	she	was	unable	to	make.	Despite	all	evidence	to	the	contrary,	she
truly	believed	she	was	able	to	move	her	paralyzed	arm.	The	researchers
concluded	that	the	experience	of	agency	in	patients	like	these	is	strongly
governed	by	cues	in	the	brain	that	precede	movement,	such	as	intentions	and
predictions	of	action,	
not
	the	actual	act

pause	in	the	moment	to	ask	ourselves	what	we	would	decide	if	we	were	really
considering	it.	Instead,	we	just	let	our	subconscious	make	the	call.	The	result	is
that	there	is	often	a	disconnect	between	what	we	truly	desire	and	what	we
actually	do.	Therefore,	we	must	consciously	create	healthier	habits	of	attention.
The	more	attention	we	give	a	particular	intention,	the	more	we	teach	our	filing
clerk	to	prioritize	it	as	an	inner	directive.	This	is	the	truth	expressed	by	the
phrase	“Where	attention	goes,	energy	flows.”	This	is	the	reason	the	cortex	is
instrumental	in	manifesting:	it	has	the	power	to	focus	our	fifty	bits	of	attention
where	we	choose.
The	important	thing	to	understand	about	the	subconscious	is	that	it	responds
to	repetition.	The	more	we	focus	on	a	particular	outcome,	visualize	it,
imaginatively	experience	it	with	
our	five	senses,	and	repeat	the	desire	to

ience.	The	brain	examines	whether	our	actions
appear	to	be	causing	the	results	we	intend	them	to	and	influencing	our
environment	as	we	choose,	and	then	uses	that	data	to	assess	whether	we	have
agency	in	the	situation.	The	humbling	truth	is	that	our	conscious	mind	does	not
have	access	to	most	of	the	subconscious	
processes	by	which	we	carry	out	actions
(such	as	our	ability	to	perform	movements),	and	therefore	it	can	only	set	an
intention,	watch	its	effects,	and	then	interpret	them	accordingly.	In	other	words,
our	sense	of	agency	is	a	
story
	our	brain	tells	us	about	our	experience.	When	the
story	the	brain	tells	us	is	that	we	do	not	have	the	power	to	perform	the	actions
necessary	to	influence	our	circumstances	for	the	better,	we	feel	disheartened	and
lose	our	motivation;	when	the	story	tells	us	we	do	have	the	capacity	to	act	on	our
desires,	we	feel	empowered,	confident,	and	integrated.
To	illustrate	the	interpretive	nature	of	agency,	we	can	examine	the	surprising
science	of	how	the	sense	of	agency	may	be	present	even	when	physical	agency	is
not.	As	a	neurosurgeon,	I	have	seen	many	patients,	either	due	to	disease	or

ortunities	to	realize	his	goals.	Evidence	confirming	the
cruelty,	randomness,	and	injustice	of	the	world	became	less	relevant	to	his	mind
and	made	way	for	hopeful	indications	of	success,	synchronicities	that	advanced
his	professional	dreams,	and	perseverance	in	the	face	of	inevitable	setbacks.
Carrey	combined	the	sense	of	empowerment,	gratitude,	and	joy	he	received
from	his	visualizations	(and	the	neurotransmitters	released	by	these	experiences
of	strong	positive	emotions)	with	the	fierce	work	ethic	he	demonstrated	in
refining	his	gifts	at	the	comedy	clubs.	The	positive	emotions	he	lived	through	in
his	mental	rehearsal	signaled	to	his	brain	that	the	experiences	he	desired	were
worthy	of	attention	and	that	mental	resources	should	be	devoted	to	pursuing
them.	In	a	sense,	he	was	hypnotizing	himself

er-order	areas	in	the	cortex
(left	anterior	and	right	middle	insula)	that	are	uniquely	associated	with	self-
reflection	and	that	facilitate	both	internal	focus	and	sustained	attention	in	the
presence	of	adverse	(e.g.,	cold)	external	stimuli.	In	other	words,	Hof’s	mental
attitude
	of	confidence	and	fearlessness	about	the	experience	allows	him	to
activate	his	upper-level	capacity	for	focus,	which	in	turn	diminishes	his	sense	of
time	and	space,	skillfully	drawing	his	attention	away	from	unpleasant	physical
sensations	and	tricking	his	body	into	skipping	its	normal	threat	response.	As	a
result,	he	enters	and	remains	in	a	kind	of	flow	state.
Although	we	are	conditioned	to	identify	with	negative	emotional	responses	to
the	external	environment,	with	practice	it	is	possible	for	us	to	recognize	our
conditioning	for	what	it	is,	and	disidentify	from	it	little	by	little.	Inner	power
arises	when	a	person	learns	to	discern	between	their	negative	conditioning	and
their	inner	awareness,	and	thereby	discovers	that	the	emotional	reaction	is
conditioned	and	not	hardwired.	The	discomfort	in	the	body	and	in	the	mind

mmentator	that
provides	detailed	thoughts	on	our	performance.
One	of	the	most	treacherous	mental	phenomena	is	the	habitual	negative	self-
talk	we	call	the	“inner	critic.”	From	a	neuroscientific	perspective,	the	inner	critic
can	be	seen	as	an	unfortunate	collaboration	between	the	default	mode	network
and	the	SNS.	When	the	DMN	gets	hooked	by	the	stress	response	of	the	SNS,	we
experience	the	sort	of	incapacitating	self-consciousness	that	kept	Anula
paralyzed.	Crucially	for	our	purposes,	the	DMN	is	negatively	correlated	with	the
attention	network	(AN),	meaning	that	the	more	it	is	activated,	the	less	access	we
have	to	the	power	of	our	attention.	The	practices	in	this	book	are	designed	in	part
to	diminish	the	overpowering	sense	of	self-consciousness	that	the	DMN
contributes	to	our	“inner	critic.”
The	DMN	has	two	powerful	lessons	for	us	in	manifesting:	first,	experiences
such	as	mind-wandering	illustrate	that	cognition	is	not	always	tethered	to	events
in	the	here	and	now.	As	we	practice,	we	will	learn	to	intentionally	detach	our
awareness	from	whatever	is	happening	in	our	five	senses	and	direct	it	toward	an
imagined	experience	of	the	future	we	envision.	Second,	when	our	mind	wanders,
it	i
