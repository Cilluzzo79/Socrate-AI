our	intention	into	the	deeper	levels	of	our	minds.	Some	are	ceremonial,	like
Lynne’s,	and	others	are	more	ordinary.	For	example,	many	of	us	write	out	our
intention	and	place	it	somewhere	we	will	see	it	every	day,	such	as	on	the
bathroom	mirror,	on	the	dashboard	of	our	car,	or	in	our	wallet.	Or	we	can	recall
Anula’s	practice	of	writing	herself	letters	and	carrying	them	with	her.	Every	time
we	see	the	paper	with	our	intention,	we	can	repeat	our	visualization	of	achieving
our	goal,	calling	into	our	minds,	bodies,	and	hearts	the	wonderful	feelings	we
will	experience	when	our	goal	becomes	reality.	As	we	practice	remembering	our
desired	result	over	and	over	again,	our	repeated	intention	to	experience	the

finally,	expressing	oneself	creatively	and	caring	about	personal,	cultural,	and
communal	identity	were	linked	to	a	life	of	meaning	but	not	of	happiness.
Many	people	seek	our	materialistic	culture’s	image	of	“happiness”	in	the	form
of	hedonic	well-being	or	having	all	of	our	wants	satisfied.	In	most	cases,	this
pursuit	fails	to	deliver	the	sense	of	a	good	life	in	the	long	term.	While	it	is	true
that	we	must	have	our	physical	needs	met	before	we	are	able	to	focus	on	seeking
meaning	and	purpose,	after	a	certain	point,	the	satisfactions	of	physical	pleasures
drop	off.	Therefore,	health,	financial	prosperity,	and	ease	in	life	all	ultimately
increase	hedonic	well-being	but	not	meaning.	For	most	of	us,	only	a	life	of

us.	We	do	not	imagine	the	pain	of	having	no	one	to	share	our	adventure	with.
And	when	we	picture	a	mansion	to	live	in,	we	see	a	warm	and	vibrant	scene	of
family	life.	We	do	not	imagine	our	family	fractured	by	a	lack	of	intimacy,	and
ourselves	alone	facing	the	sale	of	our	home.	We	imagine	the	things	we	want,	but
not	the	complexities	they	bring.	We	imagine	the	widow’s	walk,	but	not	the
possums.
Before	I	could	think	about	what	I	wanted	to	manifest	in	the	next	stage	of	my
life,	I	had	to	understand	what	I	had	
already
	manifested,	and	assess	its	value	with
a	clear	head	and	an	
open	heart.	What	had	worked	and	what	hadn’t?	What	was
my	role	in	manifesting	the	empty	mansion,	the	broken	family,	the	dead	end?
How	had	my	thinking,	my	unexamined	beliefs,	and	my	unfinished	business	with
my	heart	contributed	to	this	quagmire?
PRACTICE:	
What	Am	I	Already	Manifesting?
In	this	practice,	I	invite	you	to	assess	your	current	situation	with	clarity	and

t	by	all	the	harsh	evidence	that	almost	all	of	my
dreams	had	failed.	As	I	drove	up,	I	saw	the	garden	my	wife	had	planted	with
such	enthusiasm	and	care.	What	had	once	grown	was	now	wilted	and	dead.
Yellow-leaved	azaleas	and	drooping	camellias	
betrayed	the	lack	of	attention	the
garden	had	been	getting	from	the	gardener	who	had	promised	to	check	in.	The
house	looked	abandoned.
What	hurt	most	was	who	was	absent	from	the	house.	Throughout	the	rooms
were	nails	or	picture	hooks	screwed	into	the	walls,	but	without	pictures.	When
my	wife	left,	she	took	all	the	family	photographs,	and	with	them,	any	reminder
that	a	family	had	lived	in	this	house.	In	the	central	living	room,	above	the
mantel,	there	was	a	rectangular	sun-shadow	and	a	hook	where	a	framed	picture
had	hung.	This	had	been	our	prized	botanical	print	of	iris	bulbs	by	the	Bavarian
master	Basilius	Besler,	which	we	had	discovered	in	a	tucked-away	antiquarian
print	shop	in	Florence	on	one	of	our	print-hunting	adventures.
Those	were	happier	times.	At	the	same	store,	we	found	a	number	of	old	maps
from	the	sixteenth	and	seventeenth	centuries	that	we	loved	and	that	I	bought.	I
remembered	feeling	happy	at	the	time,	and	that	I	was	making	her

expensive	car,	you	will	create	happiness	and	find	the	behavioral	changes	that	are
required	to	realize	our	desires.	And	perhaps	most	damaging,	it	has	spread	the
idea	that	the	painful	and	unjust	circumstances	we	experience	are	entirely	the
result	of	our	own	thinking.	I	hope	that	what	I	share	with	you	in	this	book	will
reframe	your	conception	of	manifestation	as	a	path	to	a	life	of	meaning	and
purpose	and,	at	the	end	of	the	day,	help	you	to	realize	what	is	truly	important.
Manifesting	has	long	been	confined	to	the	same	New	Age	territory	as
astrology,	tarot	cards,	and	belief	in	the	power	of	crystals,	full	of	pseudoscience
and	platitudes.	Until	recently,	it	was	not	possible	to	scientifically	study	the
concrete	processes	by	which	the	brain	turns	intention	into	reality.	But	significant
developments	in	imaging	have	revolutionized	our	ability	to	watch	the	brain
transform	on	a	cellular,	genetic,	and	even	molecular	level.	We	can	now	speak
about	manifestation	in	terms	of	cognitive	neuroscience	and
