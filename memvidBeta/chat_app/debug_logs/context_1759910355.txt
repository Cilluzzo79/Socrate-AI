	the	conversation	about	manifesting	is	focused	mainly	on	the
pursuit	of	fabulous	wealth	and	outward	success	measured	by	society’s
materialistic	standards.	This	is	a	distortion	of	the	manifesting	process	and	its
deeper	potential.	Sadly,	the	power	of	manifesting	has	been	somewhat	distorted
by	the	false	narrative	of	our	culture,	which	promises	that	achieving	material
success	will	fill	a	sense	of	emotional	emptiness.	Sitting	in	my	mansion	with	my

noteworthy.	In	practice,	this	means	that	regardless	of	whether	or	not	that
intention	is	present	on	a	conscious	level,	brain	mechanisms	that	remain	focused
on	the	goal	are	activated	around	the	clock.	Our	inner	intention	now	guides	our
life.	By	using	our	inner	power	to	tap	the	vast	resources	of	our	own	brain,	we
gradually	decrease	the	impact	of	our	external	environment	and	begin	living	from
our	deepest	intentions.
In	fact,	the	first	step	in	successfully	manifesting	is	to	separate	yourself	from
the	belief	that	there	is	an	external	source	for	solving	your	problems,	and	that	this
external	source	is	what	is	manifesting	in	your	life.	If	you	want	to	lead	a	rich,
meaningful,	and	prosperous	life,	you	do	not	have	to	appease	any	power	beyond
yourself.	You	simply	must	believe	that	the	source	of	your	well-being	and	success
is	nothing	other	than	the	power	of	your	own	mind.	The	reality	is	that	the	same

expensive	car,	you	will	create	happiness	and	find	the	behavioral	changes	that	are
required	to	realize	our	desires.	And	perhaps	most	damaging,	it	has	spread	the
idea	that	the	painful	and	unjust	circumstances	we	experience	are	entirely	the
result	of	our	own	thinking.	I	hope	that	what	I	share	with	you	in	this	book	will
reframe	your	conception	of	manifestation	as	a	path	to	a	life	of	meaning	and
purpose	and,	at	the	end	of	the	day,	help	you	to	realize	what	is	truly	important.
Manifesting	has	long	been	confined	to	the	same	New	Age	territory	as
astrology,	tarot	cards,	and	belief	in	the	power	of	crystals,	full	of	pseudoscience
and	platitudes.	Until	recently,	it	was	not	possible	to	scientifically	study	the
concrete	processes	by	which	the	brain	turns	intention	into	reality.	But	significant
developments	in	imaging	have	revolutionized	our	ability	to	watch	the	brain

we	were	worthy	to	receive	our	dream	house	or	to	meet	our	soulmate	or	to	be
cured	of	cancer.	As	a	neuroscientist	and	physician,	I	know	today	that	we	have	no
proof	of	such	a	force	or	being	but	we	have	a	great	deal	of	scientific	evidence	of
the	power	of	our	own	minds	to	produce	changes	in	our	lives	that	may	at	first
appear	impossible.	This	is	the	practice	of	manifestation.
There	is	much	confusion	about	manifestation	in	popular	culture,	so	before	I
go	any	further,	here	is	what	I	mean	by	the	term:	
manifesting
	is	defining	an

And	when	we	picture	a	mansion	to	live	in,	we	see	a	warm	and	vibrant	scene	of
family	life.	We	do	not	imagine	our	family	fractured	by	a	lack	of	intimacy,	and
ourselves	alone	facing	the	sale	of	our	home.	We	imagine	the	things	we	want,	but
not	the	complexities	they	bring.	We	imagine	the	widow’s	walk,	but	not	the

Before	I	could	think	about	what	I	wanted	to	manifest	in	the	next	stage	of	my
