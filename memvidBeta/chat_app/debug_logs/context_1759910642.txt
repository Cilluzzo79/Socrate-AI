to	determine	that	a	stimulus—in	this	case,	our	desired	intention—requires	higher
cognitive	processing.	This	interaction	then	activates	the	CEN	and	deactivates	the
ceaselessly	monologuing	default	mode	network,	dynamically	allowing	us	to
focus	and	direct	our	thinking	at	will	without	distraction	or	self-consciousness.
The	teamwork	of	the	networks	opens	a	pathway	for	us	to	embed	our	intention	in
our	subconscious,	which	in	turn	causes	significant	resources	in	the	brain	to	be
devoted	to	bringing	it	about	in	reality.

cted	not	only	to	their
deepest	selves	but	to	others,	even	to	the	earth	itself.	This	state	of	internal	and
external	connectedness	is	considered	a	coherent	state	of	being.	Coherence
implies	correlations,	connectedness,	consistency,	and	efficient	energy	utilization.
Coherence	is	also	used	to	describe	the	coupling	and	degree	of	synchronization
between	different	oscillating	systems.	It	can	appear	at	one	level	of	scale	that	a
given	system	is	operating	autonomously,	yet	it	is	perfectly	coordinated	within
the	whole.
We	can	witness	the	emergence	of	coherence	all	around	us.

ill	learn	to	intentionally	detach	our
awareness	from	whatever	is	happening	in	our	five	senses	and	direct	it	toward	an
imagined	experience	of	the	future	we	envision.	Second,	when	our	mind	wanders,
it	inevitably	starts	to	elaborate	on	internal	representations,	and	this	is	the
foundation	of	our	
internal	sense	of	self.	While	this	sense	of	self	is	invaluable	for
all	kinds	of	interactions	and	daily	activities	in	life,	it	can	gravely	interfere	with
the	flow	state	required	to	inhabit	our	vision	fully,	and	so	we	must	learn	to	turn
down	its	volume.

Now	that	we	know	our	starting	point	and	have	clearly	seen	the	life	we	are
already	manifesting,	we	can	begin	the	process	of	creating	the	life	we	want	to
work	toward.	But	before	we	embark	on	our	manifestation	journey,	we	need	to

## Pagina 131

In	terms	of	the	mind,	most	would	argue	that	we	have	a	conscious,	a
subconscious	(or	preconscious),	and	an	unconscious.	
The	automatic	parts	of	our
nervous	system,	composed	of	the	subconscious	and	unconscious,	represent	a	part
of	our	mind	below	our	conscious	awareness.	We	discussed	previously	the	image
of	the	mind	as	an	iceberg,	with	the	conscious	mind	(what	we	are	aware	of	in
ordinary	waking	consciousness)	representing	that	which	is	above	the	water	and
constituting	less	than	10	percent	of	the	mind,	while	the	subconscious	and
unconscious	make	up	the	remaining	90	percent	hidden	below	the	surface	of	
the
water.	At	its	simplest,	the	conscious	mind	means	having	awareness	of	internal
and	external	existence.	This	awareness	is	based	on	the	five	senses,	the	qualia
(the	subjective	interpretation	of	the	senses),	and	the	conscious	access	to	memory
and	prior	experience.	Today,	the	definition	often	includes	any	kind	of	feeling,
cognition,	or	perception.
