ilities	of	a	given	situation.	There	may	be	a	large
gap	between	a	person’s	feeling	of	inner	power	and	their	ability	to	express	that
power	in	practice.	In	a	sense,	many	of	us	suffer	from	the	opposite	of	the	patients
with	anosognosia:	we	labor	under	the	delusion	that	we	are	paralyzed,	when	we
are	in	fact	fully	able	to	act	effectively!
In	psychology,	
self-efficacy
	is	the	belief	of	an	individual	in	their	capacity	to
act	in	the	ways	that	are	necessary	to	achieve	their	goals.	Self-efficacy	may
influence	how	and	why	individuals	choose	to	participate	in	or	stick	with	an
activity,	and	it	is	believed	to	be	a	more	accurate	predictor	of	behavior	than	a
person’s	actual	ability.

concluded	that	the	experience	of	agency	in	patients	like	these	is	strongly
governed	by	cues	in	the	brain	that	precede	movement,	such	as	intentions	and
predictions	of	action,	
not
	the	actual	actions	themselves.	The	story	the	woman’s
brain	was	telling	her	about	her	power	to	act	was	radically	different	from	her
physical	reality.
The	important	point	here	is	that	the	sense	of	agency	is	really	a	perceived
subjective
	experience	that	can	be	influenced	by	our	own	thought	processes.
Therefore,	the	depth	and	efficacy	of	our	sense	of	inner	power	comes	down	to	the
story	we	tell	ourselves	about	our	ability	to	express	that	power.	As	we	will
explore	in	future	chapters,	the	feeling	of	inner	power	is	ultimately	the	feeling	of
being	able	to	direct	the	full	capacity	of	our	brain	toward	an	intention	we	choose,
in	particular	harnessing	the	power	of	our	subconscious.	And	the	strange	thing
about	the	subconscious	is	that	it	runs	on	beliefs.	What	we	subconsciously	believe
is	often	what	limits	the	possibilities	of	a	given	situation.	There	may	be	a	large
gap	between	a	person’s	feeling	of	inner	power	and	their	ability	to	express	that
power	in	practice.	In	a	sense,	many	of	us	suffer	from	the	opposite	of

with	integration	of	self-awareness,	these	patients	may	be	unaware	on	a	conscious
level	that	their	movements	are	impaired.
Researchers	at	the	University	of	Turin	examining	such	patients	made	a
surprising	discovery.	One	woman	presented	severe	and	persistent	anosognosia
for	the	paralysis	on	her	left	side.	She	never	spontaneously	reported	her	motor
problems.	When	questioned	about	her	left	arm,	she	always	claimed	that	it	could
move	without	any	problem.	When	asked	to	actually	perform	movements	with	it,
she	attempted	to	perform	the	action,	and	after	a	few	seconds	she	appeared	to	be
satisfied	with	her	performance.	This	woman	experienced	a	sense	of	agency	for
movements	she	was	unable	to	make.	Despite	all	evidence	to	the	contrary,	she
truly	believed	she	was	able	to	move	her	paralyzed	arm.	The	researchers
concluded	that	the	experience	of	agency	in	patients	like	these	is	strongly

he	training	had	worked.
Finally,	Amari	spoke	from	his	heart.	“Please	do	not	call	me	by	that	name,”	he
told	Shaun.	“I	don’t	like	it.”
At	the	beginning	of	the	summer,	Lois	and	Colin	had	measured	Amari’s
emotional	state,	and	then	measured	it	again	at	the	end.	After	six	weeks,	his
depression	and	anxiety	had	decreased	while	his	compassion	for	self	and	others
had	risen.	His	parents	were	thrilled;	they	knew	something	magical	was
happening.
As	Amari	and	the	other	students	had	learned	to	regulate	their	responses,	they
slowly	regained	an	extraordinary	capacity:	they	took	back	their	ability	to	direct
attention	where	they	chose—away	from	stress	and	conditioning	and	reaction	and
toward	a	new	response	that	embodied	the	kind	of	people	they	longed	in	their
hearts	to	be.	As	they	reclaimed	their	attention,	choice	returned,	and	choice
signaled	the	presence	of	an	inner	power	that	is	the	essential	element	in	carrying
out	any	intention.	In	neuroscience,	this	inner	power	is	known	as	
self-agency
.
INNER	POWER
Within	each	of	us	is	an	incredible	inner	power	that	we	limit	by	our	own	beliefs.
It	is	the	power	to	endure	discomfort,	to	delay	gratification,	to	decide	what	we	let
into	our	minds	from	our	environme
