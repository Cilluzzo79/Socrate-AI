t	by	all	the	harsh	evidence	that	almost	all	of	my
dreams	had	failed.	As	I	drove	up,	I	saw	the	garden	my	wife	had	planted	with
such	enthusiasm	and	care.	What	had	once	grown	was	now	wilted	and	dead.
Yellow-leaved	azaleas	and	drooping	camellias	
betrayed	the	lack	of	attention	the
garden	had	been	getting	from	the	gardener	who	had	promised	to	check	in.	The
house	looked	abandoned.
What	hurt	most	was	who	was	absent	from	the	house.	Throughout	the	rooms
were	nails	or	picture	hooks	screwed	into	the	walls,	but	without	pictures.	When
my	wife	left,	she	took	all	the	family	photographs,	and	with	them,	any	reminder
that	a	family	had	lived	in	this	house.	In	the	central	living	room,	above	the
mantel,	there	was	a	rectangular	sun-shadow	and	a	hook	where	a	framed	picture
had	hung.	This	had	been	our	prized	botanical	print	of	iris	bulbs	by	the	Bavarian
master	Basilius	Besler,	which	we	had	discovered	in	a	tucked-away	antiquarian
print	shop	in	Florence	on	one	of	our	print-hunting	adventures.
Those	were	happier	times.	At	the	same	store,	we	found	a	number	of	old	maps
from	the	sixteenth	and	seventeenth	centuries	that	we	loved	and	that	I	bought.	I
remembered	feeling	happy	at	the	time,	and	that	I	was	making	her

Don’t	specifically	fixate	on	one	image	or	thought	but	let	your	mind
wander,	thinking	of	experiences	in	your	life	in	which	you	felt	safe

and	fulfilled.

Sit	with	these	feelings	for	a	few	minutes.	If	you	don’t	believe	you

like.
