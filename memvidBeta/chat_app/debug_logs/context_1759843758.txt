the x in the formula.] He does this to facilitate his preconceived utiliza­
tion of such experiences, namely to feel himself slighted, cheated, or a 
sufferer, in order to create for himself the familiar and desired basis for 
aggression. From this it follows that the neurotic creates from reality and 
his own potentialities the number and kind of character traits and emo­
tional readinesses which are in accord with his personality ideal. In the 
same manner the patient grows into his symptoms, which arise from the 
sum total of his experience in the very form which appears necessary and 
useful for his self-enhancement. This modus vivendi  has been conceived 
and retained by a self-determined goal and does not contain the slightest 
trace of a predetermined, innate ( autochthonous ) teleology.
According to the purposive nature of the neurotic life-plan the ques­
tion of conservation or loss of psychological energy loses all meaning. 
The patient will always have produced just enough psychological energy 
to maintain his course toward superiority, masculine protest, and god­
likeness.
COMMENT Adler’s replacement on the right side of the equation of  
“Neurosis” by “Personality Ideal” corresponds to the shift  
from the mechanistic to the Enalistic view of causality.

in the process.
a. Social Embeddedness
1. COMMUNAL LIFE AS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH1
In addition to regarding an individual’s life as a unity, we must also 
take it together with its context of social relations. Thus children when 
first bom are weak, and their weakness makes it necessary for other per­
sons to care for them. The style or the pattern of a child’s life cannot 
be understood without reference to the persons who look after him and 
who make up for his inferiority. The child has interlocking relations 
with the mother and family which could never be understood if we con­
fined our analysis to the periphery of the child’s physical being in space. 
The individuality of the child cuts across his physical individuality, it 
involves a whole context of social relations.
In order to understand what goes on in an individual, it is necessary to 
consider his attitude toward his fellow men. The relationships of peo­
ple to one another in part exist naturally and as such are subject to 
change. In part they take the form of institutionalized relationships 
which arise from the natural ones. These institutionalized relationships 
can be observed especially in the political life of nations, in the forma­
tion of states, and in community affairs. Human psychological life can-

as an extremely deep significance for the development of the 
human psychological life. Logical thought is possible only under the sup­
position of language. By making concept-formation possible, language en­
ables us to make distinctions and to create concepts which are not private 
but common property. Our thinking and feeling are also understandable 
only when one presupposes general validity. Our enjoyment of beauty is 
founded on the understanding that appreciation and recognition of the 
beautiful and the good must be common property. Thus we arrive at the 
conclusion that the concepts of reason, logic, ethics, and aesthetics can 
have taken their origin only in the communal life of man and that they 
are at the same time the cement which protects culture from disintegra­
tion.
We understand now that all the rules of the game—such as education, 
superstition, totem and tabu, and law—which were necessary to secure the 
existence of the human race, had first of all to do justice to the idea of 
a community. What we call justice, considering it the bright side of the 
human character, is essentially nothing other than the fulfillment of de­
mands which have arisen from man’s communal life. It is these demands 
which have shaped the psychological organ. Dependability, loyalty, frank­
ness, and truthfulness are actually demands posited and maintained by a 
generally valid principle of the community. What we call a good or a bad 
character can be judged only from the viewpoint of the community.

activity and brings about striking, often superior and novel psycho­
logical phenomena.
The real deprivation, as for instance, the restriction of food in child­
hood, is felt as an abstract “nothing,” as want, in contrast to which the 
child now demands everything, abundance, until he brings this goal con­
ceptually nearer in the person of the father, a fabulous rich person, or a 
mighty emperor. The more intensely the want has been felt, the stronger 
and higher the fictional ideal is posited.
It is the child’s helplessness, clumsiness, and insecurity which necessi­
tate the exploration of possibilities, the gathering of experiences, and the 
creation of memory for the purpose of constructing a bridge into the 
future where reside greatness, power, and satisfactions of all sorts. The 
construction of this bridge is the most important achievement of the 
child, because otherwise he would find himself without composure, 
counsel, guidance, or comfort in the midst of inpouring impressions. One 
can scarcely delimit or express in words this first stage of the awakening 
subjective world, of the formation of the self. Nevertheless, we can 
say that the guiding image of the child must be constructed ‘as if’ it were 
able, by influencing the direction of his will, to bring him greater se­
curity and orientation.
Our consideration has led us to understand how, from the absolute 
inferiority of the child, especially of the one who is constitutionally 
burdened, a self-evaluation develops which produces the feeling of in­
feriority.

94THE INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY OF ALFRED ADLER
3. THE UNITY OF THE PERSONALITY9
Our mental life is not a matter of simple existence but is subject to 
certain impulsions. It is through this urge towards processes directed to 
a given end that the whole mental life receives an impetus in a forward 
direction, and in this stream of processes all the categories and forces be­
longing to our minds receive their mold, their direction, and their char­
acteristic form. The development of the mental life of man is accom­
plished with the help of a fictional teleology through the proposing of a 
certain end under the pressure of a teleological apperception. Thus it 
finally becomes evident that in every mental phenomenon we discover 
anew the characteristic of pursuit of a goal, and all our powers, faculties, 
experiences, wishes and fears, defects and capacities fall into line with 
this characteristic.
The goal of the mental life of man becomes its governing principle, its 
causa Enalis.  Here we have the root of the unity of the personality, 
the individuality. It does not matter what the source of its energies may 
have been.

[Sezione: ons. The feeling] [Sezione 11 di 34]

ons. The feeling 
of belongingness, the social interest, takes root in the psyche of the child 
and leaves the individual only under the severest pathological changes 
of his mental life.
Social interest remains throughout life. It becomes differentiated, lim­
ited, or expanded and, in favorable cases, extends not only to family mem­
bers but to the larger group, to the nation, to all of mankind. It can 
even go further, extending itself to animals, plants, and inanimate ob­
jects and finally even to the cosmos.
The educability of the child derives from the breadth of his innate, 
differentiated, and growing social interest. Through it he gains the con­
nection with the common ideal. In this way the demands of the com­
munity become personal demands, and the immanent logic of human 
society, with its matters of course and necessities, becomes the indi­
vidual task for the child.
The indomitable progress of social interest, growing through evolu­
tion [in the sense of societal evolution, see p. 106], justifies the as­
sumption that the very existence of mankind is inseparably tied up with 
being good. Whatever seems to speak against this assumption is to be 
regarded as a mistake of [societal] evolution and can be traced to errors.
Self-boundedness is an artifact thrust upon the child during his educa­
tion and by the present state of our social structure. The creative power 
of the child is misled towards self-boundedness.

ben),  and in which direction does he move it? The mover is always the 
self.
All inherited possibilities and all influences of the body, all environ­
mental influences, including educational application, are perceived, as­
similated, digested, and answered by a living and striving being, striving 
for a successful achievement in his view. The subjectiveness of the indi­
vidual, his special style of life, and his conception of life mold and shape 
all influences. The individual life collects all these influences and uses 
them as provocative bricks in building a totality which aims toward a 
successful goal in relating itself to outside problems. This provocation 
and the child’s opinion of life and opinion of himself are creations of 
the mostly forgotten child.
When we examine the chosen direction of individuals, we find thou­
sands of different answers. Whatever the chosen direction, behind it 
is the opinion of life and the style of living. This is the creation of the 
forgotten child, his independent creation, forgotten so long as only the 
bricks are considered.

[Sezione: gical life. This difflculty of understanding others] [Sezione 10 di 34]

gical life. This difflculty of understanding others 
becomes all the greater the further we depart from our own circum­
stances.
One of the basic facts for the advancement of our understanding of 
human nature is that we must regard the inherent rules of the game of a 
group as these emerge within the limited organization of the human 
body and its achievements, as if they were an absolute truth. We are 
able to approach this truth only slowly and usually only after mistakes 
and errors have been overcome.
The demands made on man by communal life are really just as self- 
evident as the demands of climate, the demands of protection against 
cold, and of building houses. We recognize religion as an expression of 
this coercion toward communal life, although not yet in a form under­
stood as such. In religion, the sanctification of social forms takes the 
place of insight into their true significance and serves as a bond between 
members of the community. If the conditions of life are determined in 
the first instance by cosmic influences, they are in the second instance 
determined socially. They are determined by the fact that men live to­
gether and by the rules and regularities which spontaneously arise in 
consequence of this. The demands of society have regulated human rela­
tions which had already existed from the beginning as self-understood, 
as an absolute truth. For before the individual life of man there was 
the community. In the history of human culture, there is not a single 
form of life which was not conducted as social.
