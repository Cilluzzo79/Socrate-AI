lf-agency	and	the	power	each	of	us	has
within	us	to	change	our	brains,	which	led	me	back	to	many	of	the	things	I
discussed	in	my	first	book.	So	it	seems	that	I	have	come	full	circle.

When	I	first	came	up	with	the	idea	for	this	book,	I	discussed	it	with	my
literary	agent,	Doug	Abrams	at	Idea	Architects,	who	was	enthusiastically
supportive.	We	created	a	proposal	that	we	presented	to	the	amazing	Caroline
Sutton,	editor-in-chief	of	Avery	(an	imprint	of	Penguin	Random	House),	the
publisher	of	my	first	book.	She	was	immediately	on	board.	Her	support,
encouragement,	and	guidance	has	been	greatly	appreciated.
Of	course,	translating	a	concept	into	a	narrative	is	not	simple	or
straightforward.	One	of	the	first	things	I	did	was	a	deep	dive	into	the	science
behind	the	topic,	reading	many	books	and	hundreds	of	articles.	My	dear	friend
Monica	Bucci,	MD,	kindly	offered	to	read	through	the	books	and	articles	as
well,	and	helped	me	by	organizing	and	summarizing	the	literature	and	giving	me
much	appreciated	input	and	advice	as	the	project	progressed.	Next,	Idea
Architects	was	kind	enough	to	recommend	Alexander	Nemser	to	collaborate
with	me,	not	only	in	regard	to	organizing	my	though

When	we	first	discover	the	depth	and	potency	of	our	own	inner	power	to
influence	our	lives	for	the	better	through	our	choices,	it	can	be	a	dizzying
prospect.	As	we	reconnect	with	our	power	of	agency,	we	may	at	first	become
overwhelmed	by	the	sense	that	we	are	responsible	for	
everything
	and	blame
ourselves	for	things	over	which	we	have	little	to	no	control.	It	can	take	practice
to	calibrate	our	perceptions	to	a	right-sized	view	of	our	inner	power.	In	the	next
chapter,	we	will	address	specifically	how	to	overcome	these	obstacles,	release
patterns	that	no	longer	serve	us,	and	learn	others	that	benefit	us.

not.	As	a	neurosurgeon,	I	have	seen	many	patients,	either	due	to	disease	or
trauma,	with	a	condition	known	as	
anosognosia

Anosognosia
	comes	from	the
Greek	words	
nosos
	(“disease”)	and	
gnosis
	(“knowledge”),	so	patients	with
anosognosia	do	not	know	or	realize	they	have	a	particular	disease	or	impairment.
One	example	is	hemiplegia,	which	describes	patients	who	are	paralyzed,	usually
following	a	stroke.	If	the	stroke	also	affects	those	areas	of	the	brain	associated

have	a	way	of	evolving	the	more
we	experience.	In	the	hierarchy	of	needs	as	posited	by	the	psychologist	Abraham
Maslow,	we	must	first	meet	our	basic	physical	requirements	for	breath,	clean
water,	food,	clothing,	and	shelter.	Only	when	these	basic	needs	are	met	can	we
focus	our	effort	and	attention	on	others,	on	our	need	to	connect,	on	those	things
beyond	our	basic	survival	such	as	the	fact	that	others	are	suffering.	That	is	our
reality.	The	good	news	is	that	manifesting	can	serve	you	wherever	you	find
yourself	on	the	hierarchy	of	needs.	Whatever	it	is	you	need,	manifesting	can
work	to	help	you	find	it.
When	I	was	a	kid	living	in	poverty,	my	focus	was	on	manifesting	the	material
needs	of	my	family.	I	used	the	same	techniques	to	get	into	college	and	later
medical	school,	and	later	to	advance	in	my	professional	life,	long	before	I	ever
thought	about	self-actualization	as	a	goal.	Like	all	of	us,	I	needed	to	achieve
some	degree	of	stability,	prosperity,	and	worth	before	I	could	turn	my	attention
to	realizing	my	higher	purpose	in	the	world.

head	in	my	hands,	I	learned	firsthand	this	was	untrue.	In	fact,	there	is	nothing
about	manifesting	that	is	inherently	about	acquiring	material	possessions.	In	a
sense,	to	envision	and	seek	only	material	gain	is	to	dream	too	small.	I	now	find	it
ironic	that	when	my	twelve-year-old	self	imagined	an	island,	it	was	to	be	private,
all	mine,	its	luxury	a	testament	to	my	personal	glory	alone;	when	Nainoa
Thompson	imagined	Tahiti,	it	held	a	deep	symbolic	meaning	not	only	for	himself
but	for	his	entire	community	and	his	lineage.	Both	of	us	imagined	islands,	but
they	were	very	different	destinations.
Knowing	clearly	what	we	truly	want	will	allow	us	to	set	our	inner	compass	in
the	right	direction;	it	will	be	the	basis	for	the	intention	we	will	consciously

As	I	listen	to	readers’	responses	to	my	work,	I	notice	that	a	significant
percentage	of	the	messages	I	receive	are	from	people	who	are	suffering	in	their
lives	and	looking	for	their	power	to	heal	their	own	wounds	and	change	their
situations	for	the	better.	Their	circumstances	are	vastly	different,	but	their

ience.	The	brain	examines	whether	our	actions
appear	to	be	causing	the	results	we	intend	them	to	and	influencing	our
environment	as	we	choose,	and	then	uses	that	data	to	assess	whether	we	have
agency	in	the	situation.	The	humbling	truth	is	that	our	conscious	mind	does	not
have	access	to	most	of	the	subconscious	
processes	by	which	we	carry	out	actions
(such	as	our	ability	to	perform	movements),	and	therefore	it	can	only	set	an
intention,	watch	its	effects,	and	then	interpret	them	accordingly.	In	other	words,
our	sense	of	agency	is	a	
story
	our	brain	tells	us	about	our	experience.	When	the
story	the	brain	tells	us	is	that	we	do	not	have	the	power	to	perform	the	actions
necessary	to	influence	our	circumstances	for	the	better,	we	feel	disheartened	and
lose	our	motivation;	when	the	story	tells	us	we	do	have	the	capacity	to	act	on	our
desires,	we	feel	empowered,	confident,	and	integrated.
To	illustrate	the	interpretive	nature	of	agency,	we	can	examine	the	surprising
science	of	how	the	sense	of	agency	may	be	present	even	when	physical	agency	is
not.	As	a	neurosurgeon,	I	have	seen	many	patients,	either	due	to	disease	or

sense	of	where	he	wanted	to	go	that	would	point	him	in	the	right	direction	and
guide	him	on	his	journey.	The	notion	of	an	inner	compass	has	stayed	with	me
and	has	helped	me	throughout	my	life.
As	we	begin	our	practice	of	manifesting,	we,	too,	start	by	
connecting	with	our
inner	compass,	our	inner	image	of	where	we	want	to	go,	the	island	arising	in	the
distance	of	our	own	vision.	This	image	fills	us	with	inspiration,	energizes	us,	and
guides	us	through	the	inevitable	ups	and	downs,	opportunities	and	setbacks	we
will	encounter	on	our	own	journey.	If	we	choose	a	worthy	destination,	entrust
our	path	to	our	inner	vision,	and	hold	to	it	even	in	the	face	of	obstacles	that
appear	insurmountable,	through	the	doldrums	where	clouds	obscure	every
familiar	reference	point	in	the	sky,	we	will	be	led	safely	where	we	need	to	go	by
the	compass	of	our	hearts.	We	must	then	set	our	minds	on	a	destination	that	is
worthy	of	our	pursuit.
But	what	is	truly	worthy	of	wanting?
WHAT	TO	WANT?
In	today’s	culture,	the	conversation	about	manifesting	is	focused	mainly	on	the
pursuit	of	fabulous	wealth	and	outward	success	measured	by	society’s
materialistic	standards.	This	is	a	distortion	of	the	manifesting	proce

mind	locked	in	the	story	that	she	did	not	feel	she	had	the	power	to	change.
Grasping	for	something	to	get	her	out	of	her	situation,	she	began	exploring
spirituality,	everything	from	astrology	to	life	after	death	to	ghosts,	and	this	led
her	to	manifestation.	While	on	a	break	at	her	job,	without	thinking	of	what	she
was	typing,	she	Googled	“Using	magic	to	get	into	med	school.”	This	led	her	to
my	first	book,	
Into	the	Magic	Shop
,	in	which	I	was	also	repeatedly	told	by	pre-
med	advisers	that	I	was	not	good	enough	to	be	accepted.	In	fact,	she	emailed	me
and	described	her	desire	to	attend	medical	school	and	her	struggles	with	anxiety.
Her	story	struck	me	and	I	responded,	which	led	us	to	have	several	telephone
conversations	about	manifestation.
Up	to	that	point,	she	had	thought	of	manifestation	as	concerned	only	with
lofty	and	distant	spiritual	goals	or	fantastic	displays	of	wealth.	The	theme	of
