## Pagina 268

COMMENT In the above  Adler describes the neurotic’s view  of the 
world  as what one might call  a caricature of an Aristotelean  
class theory. This is, of  course, the direct opposite of what he considered  
the correct view, which recognizes no classes, but only interacting forces.
According to Adler the neurotic’s way of thinking is  characterized by 
antitheses, dichotomies, and prejudice.  All of these are seen as dogmatized  
fictions to which the neurotic clings as a crutch (see above ) to support  
him in his efforts at coping with the world  in the face of his feeling of  
insecurity. Here Adler anticipated important recent research on social  
prejudice. In  summarizing these studies Allport states they have  shown 
“beyond a doubt that prejudiced attitudes may serve as a psychological  
crutch for persons crippled in their encounters with life. . . . From this  
point of view prejudice would seem to be largely a device for  handling 
basic insecurity”  (5, p. 12). The similarity of Allport’s terminology here  
with that of Adler is striking.
5. THE MASCULINE PROTEST (1912, 1913) 9
The understanding of the world according to concrete pairs of op­
posites corresponds to the primitive attempts of the child to orient him­
self in the world and to safeguard himself. Among these pairs I have 
regularly found: (1) above-below  and (2) masculine-feminine.

ties only, not direct causes” 
(1933c, p. 74). Explanation of the individual case is possible only from 
the individual’s own inner nature.
The inner relationships are discovered by the method of phenomenol- 
ogy, which Jaspers uses in Edmund Husserl’s sense as the descriptive 
psychology of the phenomena of consciousness. The understanding of 
these descriptions is based on empathy (59, p. 253). Phenomenology is 
an empirical method based exclusively on communication on the part 
of the subject, and in principle does not differ from the method of ob­
jective description (59, p. 47). But in practice a good phenomenological 
description is particularly difficult. “Just as children at first draw what 
they know rather than what they see, so the psychopathologist goes 
through a stage where he somehow reasons out the psychological 
content of the patient before he reaches an unprejudiced immediate 
comprehension of the psychological content as it is. The phenomeno­
logical attitude represents an ever new effort and a property which must 
be ever newly acquired through the overcoming of prejudices” (59, 
p. 48).
Although Adler did not use the term phenomenology, he consistently 
used the method in that he emphasized the unprejudiced approach to 
the patient, and based his understanding on empathy. This he de­
fined simply in the demand, “We must be able to see with his eyes and 
listen with his ears” (1931a, p. 72).
As soon as Jaspers’ work began to appear in 1912-1913, his similarity 
to Adler was observed (50; 86) and continued to be observed (93).

2. PREJUDICE AND HOSTILITY6
Those who have travelled have found that people everywhere are 
approximately the same in that they are always inclined to find some­
thing by which to degrade others. Everyone seeks a means which per­
mits him to elevate himself at little cost. The Frenchman considers the 
German inferior, whereas the German, in turn, considers himself as be­
longing to a chosen nation; the Chinaman disdains the Japanese. One 
sees this also between the bourgeois and proletarian. Until mankind 
consents to take a step forward in its degree of civilization, these hostile 
trends [prejudices] must be considered not as specific manifestations, 
but as the expression of a general and erroneous human attitude.
What I have said concerning the hatreds and jealousies between na­
tions and groups also holds good of the bitter struggle between the 
sexes, a struggle that is poisoning love and marriage and is ever born 
anew out of the inferior valuation of woman. The idealized picture of 
overestimated masculinity imposes both on the boy and the grown-up 
man the obligation of appearing, if not being, superior to woman. This 
causes him to distrust himself, to exaggerate his demands on life and his 
expectations from it, and increases his sense of insecurity.

ment in the clinic and in the classroom. The remaining Chapters 17 to 19 
deal with crime and related disorders, problems of everyday living, and 
problems of social psychology, specifically including social prejudice, war, 
and religion.
Autobiographical and biographical material on Adler is found in the 
last part of Chapter 7 and incidentally throughout the book.
In addition to the selections from Adler and the comments by the 
editors the book contains three readings by other authors. The first, in 
Chapter 2, is from a paper by Kenneth M. Colby presenting an account 
of the discussion which followed Adler’s critique of Freud before the 
Psychoanalytic Society of Vienna in 1911. The second, in Chapter 3, 
consists of excerpts from The Philosophy of ‘As If  by Hans Vaihinger 
which exerted a far-reaching influence on Adler, as becomes evident 
throughout this volume. The third, in Chapter 5, is from the monograph 
on “Psychoanalysis and Ethics” by Carl Furtmiiller, Adler’s foremost 
early coworker; this paper seems to have played an important part in Ad­
ler’s formulation of the concept of social interest.
This book could not have been conceived nor completed if we had 
not had extensive personal contact with Adler.

social interest  itself, some thirty years after Adler had introduced it. Under 
the heading of social interest Solomon E. Asch describes the striving for 
society as a primary, natural tendency, and makes a sharp distinction be­
tween this and the conception of socialization by Freud and others (10).
. FIELD THEORY
A special aspect of Gestalt psychology is the field theory of Lewin. 
The parallels between Lewin and Adler are particularly marked. Lewin 
is said to have once characterized the position of Gestalt psychology 
“as having confirmed experimentally the correctness of the Adlerian 
views” (87), and in fact his studies on level of aspiration are an exam­
ple of such a confirmation.
In the present connection we shall limit ourselves to the brief discus­
sion of two fundamental similarities of theory. The first is the rejection 
of fixed class concepts. In his first book, published in 1912, Adler took 
a stand against Aristotelian class concepts and against all dichotomies as 
doing violence to the facts. He showed that categorical and dichotomized 
thinking is characteristic of the primitive mind and of the neurotic in 
his prejudiced mode of apperception and greater need for security.

heory. The first is the rejection

doing violence to the facts. He showed that categorical and dichotomized 
thinking is characteristic of the primitive mind and of the neurotic in 
his prejudiced mode of apperception and greater need for security. It 
was in accordance with this denial of specific categories that Adler also 
denied the existence of specific mental diseases as such, and stressed 
the unity of the neuroses (1912a). This rejection of categories was later 
worked out in much greater detail by Lewin in his important paper on 
Aristotelian and Galilean modes of thought, in which he described the 
process of progressive homogenization, that is, the doing away with rigid 
classes and antitheses, which has been found to accompany the advance 
of scientific theorizing (67).
Adler believed that different parts of life are made entities artificially 
by giving them more or less adequate man-made names (1937a). He had 
a profound distrust of incisive terminology and therefore kept his techni­
cal terminology to a minimum. This is quite in contrast to the way of a 
categorizing mind like that of Freud, who built up a rich terminology 
to express a highly ramified theory.

ings us to 
another recent development, the personality theory of Carl Rogers (90), 
based on clinical and research evidence obtained with his method of 
client-centered therapy. The fascinating aspect in Rogers is that at first 
he approached the patient or client without any theory at all, following 
him empathically without any attempt at explanation, not even on the 
basis of internal causes. Methodologically he thus represents the un­
prejudiced phenomenological approach in its purest form, applied to 
psychotherapy.
Eventually Rogers developed a theory on the basis of careful observa­
tion of the entire therapeutic process and a synthesis of some fifteen 
authors whom we would for the most part classify as subjective. The out­
come is a series of propositions which could be matched to a considerable 
extent with the propositions derived from Adler and presented above. 
Just to give a few examples, Rogers refers to: one basic tendency and 
striving to actualize, maintain, and enhance the experiencing organism; 
behavior as goal-directed; the individual as an organized whole; the con­
sistency of the self; the individually perceived world; and better inter­
personal relations as the outcome of therapy.

g, the brain. In the 
laboratory of nature, all three safeguards can be found. While peripheral 
defects or accentuated pain and pleasure sensations may arise in the in­
ferior organ, the most variable part, the central nervous system, takes over 
the final compensation.
COMMENT What  Adler does here in fact is to  state his position as a  
centialistie rather than a peripheralistic psychologist. It is  
the central nervous system which  inaugurates the compensation, thus  
making all peripheral functions, including sex, subordinate to one central  
function. Later the safeguarding tendency virtually replaced compensa­
tion.
2. RELATIVITY OF LIBIDO11
It is a double wrong to confuse the concept of the inferior organ with 
the “erogenous zone” of Havelock Ellis. First, only a small part of the 
inferior organs shows an increased pleasure feeling or feels a tickle in its 
peripheral part. Should one, as Sadger attempts, count the inferior urinary 
passage, gall bladder, pancreas, adenoids, and lymph glands among the 
erogenous zones? Second, the concept of the erogenous zone is unjustly 
prejudiced. We do not want to deny that conscious and unconscious per­
verse fantasies may be associated with the inferior organ. But this occurs 
only later in life, with the aid of false notions about sex or under the 
pressure of certain safeguarding tendencies. In order to become erogenous, 
such zones need a secondary confluence of drives under the pressure of
