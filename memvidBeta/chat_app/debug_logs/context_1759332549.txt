t	by	all	the	harsh	evidence	that	almost	all	of	my
dreams	had	failed.	As	I	drove	up,	I	saw	the	garden	my	wife	had	planted	with
such	enthusiasm	and	care.	What	had	once	grown	was	now	wilted	and	dead.
Yellow-leaved	azaleas	and	drooping	camellias	
betrayed	the	lack	of	attention	the
garden	had	been	getting	from	the	gardener	who	had	promised	to	check	in.	The
house	looked	abandoned.
What	hurt	most	was	who	was	absent	from	the	house.	Throughout	the	rooms
were	nails	or	picture	hooks	screwed	into	the	walls,	but	without	pictures.	When
my	wife	left,	she	took	all	the	family	photographs,	and	with	them,	any	reminder
that	a	family	had	lived	in	this	house.	In	the	central	living	room,	above	the
mantel,	there	was	a	rectangular	sun-shadow	and	a	hook	where	a	framed	picture
had	hung.	This	had	been	our	prized	botanical	print	of	iris	bulbs	by	the	Bavarian
master	Basilius	Besler,	which	we	had	discovered	in	a	tucked-away	antiquarian
print	shop	in	Florence	on	one	of	our	print-hunting	adventures.
Those	were	happier	times.	At	the	same	store,	we	found	a	number	of	old	maps
from	the	sixteenth	and	seventeenth	centuries	that	we	loved	and	that	I	bought.	I
remembered	feeling	happy	at	the	time,	and	that	I	was	making	her

sense	of	where	he	wanted	to	go	that	would	point	him	in	the	right	direction	and
guide	him	on	his	journey.	The	notion	of	an	inner	compass	has	stayed	with	me
and	has	helped	me	throughout	my	life.
As	we	begin	our	practice	of	manifesting,	we,	too,	start	by	
connecting	with	our
inner	compass,	our	inner	image	of	where	we	want	to	go,	the	island	arising	in	the
distance	of	our	own	vision.	This	image	fills	us	with	inspiration,	energizes	us,	and
guides	us	through	the	inevitable	ups	and	downs,	opportunities	and	setbacks	we
will	encounter	on	our	own	journey.	If	we	choose	a	worthy	destination,	entrust
our	path	to	our	inner	vision,	and	hold	to	it	even	in	the	face	of	obstacles	that
appear	insurmountable,	through	the	doldrums	where	clouds	obscure	every
familiar	reference	point	in	the	sky,	we	will	be	led	safely	where	we	need	to	go	by
the	compass	of	our	hearts.	We	must	then	set	our	minds	on	a	destination	that	is
worthy	of	our	pursuit.
But	what	is	truly	worthy	of	wanting?
WHAT	TO	WANT?
In	today’s	culture,	the	conversation	about	manifesting	is	focused	mainly	on	the
pursuit	of	fabulous	wealth	and	outward	success	measured	by	society’s
materialistic	standards.	This	is	a	distortion	of	the	manifesting	proce

e’s	love	for	his	island	and	its	ocean.
Standing	on	the	shore	overlooking	the	waves	Thompson	was	about	to	face,
Mau	asked,	“Can	you	point	in	the	direction	of	Tahiti?”
Thompson	pointed.


## Pagina 82

“Now,”	said	Mau,	“can	you	see	the	island?”
Thompson	was	confused.	Of	course,	he	couldn’t	see	Tahiti—it	was	over	two
thousand	miles	away.	But	he	understood	Mau	meant	his	question	seriously.	He
considered	it	for	a	long	time,	then	answered,	“I	cannot	see	the	island,	but	I	can
see	an	image	of	the	island	in	my	mind.”
Mau	said,	“Good.	Don’t	ever	lose	that	image	or	you	will	be	lost.”
Then	he	turned	to	Thompson	and	said,	“Let’s	get	in	the	car,	let’s	go	home.”
This	was	Mau’s	last	lesson.	“
He	was	telling	me	that	I	had	to	trust	myself,”
Thompson	said	later,	“and	that	if	I	had	a	vision	of	where	I	wanted	to	go	and	held
on	to	it,	I	would	get	there.”
I	first	heard	this	story	from	a	meditation	teacher	who	pointed	out	that	Mau
was	instructing	Thompson	to	trust	his	inner	compass,	the	innate	and	instinctive
sense	of	where	he	wanted	to	go	that	would	point	him	in	the	right	direction	and
guide	him	on	his	journey.	The	notion	of	an	inner	compass	has	stayed	with	me
and	has	helped	me	throughout	my	life.
