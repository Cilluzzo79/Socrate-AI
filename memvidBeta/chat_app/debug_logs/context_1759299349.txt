nesia,
the	highest	mountain	peak	on	an	island.	At	over	sixteen	thousand	feet,	it	is	one
of	the	Seven	Summits,	the	highest	mountains	on	each	of	the	seven	traditional
continents.	It	was	2015,	and	Puncak	Jaya	was	the	fifth	summit	Silvia	had
climbed,	having	undertaken	Kilimanjaro	in	Tanzania,	Mount	Elbrus	in	Russia,
Aconcagua	in	Argentina,	and	Mount	Kosciuszko	in	Australia.
The	climbs	were	not	just	recreational;	they	had	a	profound	symbolic	meaning
for	Silvia.	Growing	up	in	Lima,	Peru,	Silvia	was	a	victim	of	childhood	sexual
abuse.	The	trauma	of	her	abuse	and	her	family’s	silence	around	it	left	deep
emotional	and	psychic	wounds.	In	her	twenties,	the	pain	led	her	into	a	spiral	of
serious	depression,	alcoholism,	and	broken	relationships	with	women	that	held
her	life	captive	as	she	concealed	her	sexuality	from	her	family.	Even	though	she
achieved	success	amidst	the	male-dominated	posturing	of	the	high-tech	Silicon
Valley	world,	she	knew	the	untended	wounds	of	her	past	were	threatening	to
swallow	her	up.	Finally,	out	of	desperation,	she	accepted	her	mother’s	invitation
in	2005	to	return	to	Peru	to	participate	in	an	ayahuasca	ceremony	during	which
she	had	a	transformative	vision:	her	younge

“Your	GPA	is	not	good	enough	for	med	school.”	She	just	had	to	go	on	living
with	the	pain	of	knowing	her	dream	but	being	unable	to	pursue	it.
After	college,	she	took	a	job	as	an	associate	data	manager	at	a	pharmaceutical
company	with	the	intention	to	continue	pursuing	her	goal	of	becoming	a	doctor.
She	tried	to	take	the	Medical	College	Admission	Test	(MCAT)	but	was
overwhelmed	by	fear.	Her	extreme	anxiety	produced	physical	symptoms:	“I
actually	wanted	to	throw	up,	I	would	pace,	and	I	couldn’t	focus.	And	when	the
pressure	would	build	up,	I	couldn’t	function.	It	hurt	my	self-esteem	and	self-
confidence	as	well.	It	shook	me.”
Once,	she	went	through	with	scheduling	the	test,	but	then	canceled	it	at	the
last	minute	due	to	nerves.	“At	one	point,”	she	remembers,	“I	was	like,	‘Oh	no,
I’m	not	going	to	get	into	medical	school,	and	everything	is	going	to	come
crashing	down.	I’m	going	to	disappoint	my	parents.	I’m	going	to	disappoint	my
community.	Everything	for	me	is	wasted	when	everyone	in	the	fa

with	integration	of	self-awareness,	these	patients	may	be	unaware	on	a	conscious
level	that	their	movements	are	impaired.
Researchers	at	the	University	of	Turin	examining	such	patients	made	a
surprising	discovery.	One	woman	presented	severe	and	persistent	anosognosia
for	the	paralysis	on	her	left	side.	She	never	spontaneously	reported	her	motor
problems.	When	questioned	about	her	left	arm,	she	always	claimed	that	it	could
move	without	any	problem.	When	asked	to	actually	perform	movements	with	it,
she	attempted	to	perform	the	action,	and	after	a	few	seconds	she	appeared	to	be
satisfied	with	her	performance.	This	woman	experienced	a	sense	of	agency	for
movements	she	was	unable	to	make.	Despite	all	evidence	to	the	contrary,	she
truly	believed	she	was	able	to	move	her	paralyzed	arm.	The	researchers
concluded	that	the	experience	of	agency	in	patients	like	these	is	strongly
governed	by	cues	in	the	brain	that	precede	movement,	such	as	intentions	and
predictions	of	action,	
not
	the	actual	act
